Initiation and choice of therapy depends not only on bone mineral\\ndensity, but other risk factors such as increased age, positive family\\nhistory, smoking (past or present), thin body habitus, treatment with\\nmedications causing bone loss, etc.  The relative risks of fracture\\napproximately doubles for each one SD reduction in bone mineral density.\\nWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (W.H.O.)

Patient109\\nPATIENT ID#: \\nDATE OF BIRTH: 05/31/1947\\nDATE OF VISIT: 06/07/2013\\n\\n\\nHistory and Physical\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  \"I am here to discuss new diagnosis of breast cancer.\"\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. Patient109 is a 66-year-old female with a past history of cystic breasts, who initially palpated a mass in the left breast a few months ago.\\nShe initially did not pay much attention to this due to her history of cysts.\\nUltimately, however, she went for a mammogram in late February 2013.\\nThis revealed a 2.6 x 2 cm lesion in the 1 o\\'clock region of the left breast.\\nIn the right breast, there were multiple simple cysts noted with irregularly decreased echogenicity in the upper outer quadrant.\\nThis was thought to possibly represent scarring from her prior excisional biopsy.\\nShe did however, undergo core biopsy of the lesion at the 1 o\\'clock region in the right breast, which revealed an atypical papillary lesion.\\nBiopsy of the left breast at 2 o\\'clock revealed atypical ductal hyperplasia.\\nAlso, of note, biopsy of the right breast at 10 o\\'clock revealed a tubular carcinoma.\\nShe ultimately underwent right segmental mastectomy along with left segmental mastectomy on April 22nd, 2013.\\nOn the right side as mentioned, she was found to have a tubular carcinoma at the 10 o\\'clock region.\\nThis was ER positive with an H-score of 300, PR positive with an H-score of 70, HER-2 1+, Ki-67 was 1%.\\nShe was staged as a pathologic T1 N0 M0.\\nRight sentinel node biopsy was negative.\\nThe right invasive tubular carcinoma measured 1.1 cm, was less than 1 mm to the anterior margin.\\nThere was also atypical lobular hyperplasia present.\\nIn the left breast at 1 o\\'clock, there was encapsulated papillary carcinoma measuring 1.9 cm.\\nShe had a positive posterior margin.\\nThere was also atypical ductal hyperplasia at both 1 o\\'clock and at 2 o\\'clock.\\nDue to the positive margins, she underwent\\nreexcision on May 13, 2013.\\nShe had excision of both the left posterior margin and left superior medial margin.\\nThis revealed DCIS at 1 o\\'clock.\\nHer new margin was free of DCIS; however, the DCIS was within less than 0.1 cm from the final margin at two foci.\\nOverall, certainly she has been feeling some stress regarding her new breast cancer diagnosis.\\nAdditionally, her husband was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, one week prior to her breast cancer diagnosis.\\nThis obviously has caused some stress in her life.\\nShe states she has gained 10-15 pounds due to stress eating.\\nOtherwise, her incisions have healed well and she denies any current pain.\\nShe denies any fevers or chills.\\nNo nausea or vomiting.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.\\nAnemia secondary to menometrorrhagia.\\n2.\\nMitral valve, questionable sclerosis, per patient previously had prolapse; however, most recent echocardiogram did not show prolapse, just hardening of the valve.\\n3.\\nThyroid nodules which are being monitored by ultrasound by endocrinology.\\n 4.\\nGynecologic history.\\nOf note, while she is currently postmenopausal of note, she was previously on hormonal therapy for 25 years.\\nShe initially was on Prempro for menometrorrhagia; however, for the past 20 years or so has been the CombiPatch for hot flashes.\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1.\\nTonsillectomy.\\n2.\\nTubal ligation.\\n3.\\nExcisional breast biopsy 15 years ago.\\nMEDICATIONS:  None.\\nALLERGIES:  TO IODINATED CONTRAST MEDIA, FOR WHICH SHE GETS ITCHING.\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Father with colon cancer at age 70.\\nSister recently diagnosed with precancerous lesion of the cervix at age 55.\\nMaternal aunt with lung cancer at age 76; however, she was a smoker.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married, has three children, ages 38, 34, and 27; all are healthy.\\nShe is a nonsmoker.\\nShe drinks occasional wine.\\nShe is retired, AP English teacher.\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\\nCONSTITUTIONAL:  She denies any fevers, chills, sweats.\\nShe has gained weight due to recent overeating.\\nOf note, she does have hot flashes since being off CombiPatch since January.\\nHEENT:  No recent upper respiratory symptoms.\\nCARDIAC:  No chest pain or palpitations.\\nRESPIRATORY:  No shortness of breath or cough.\\nGASTROINTESTINAL:  No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, melena, or hematochezia.\\nGENITOURINARY:  No changes in urination.\\nThe remainder of the review of systems was reviewed and is negative.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  She appears well.\\nShe is in no acute distress.\\nECOG performance status 0.\\nPain is 0/10.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.6, heart rate 82, respirations 18, blood pressure 100/62.\\nHeight is 70-3/4 inches, weight is 197 pounds.\\nO2 saturation 97% on room air.\\nEYES:  She has no scleral icterus.\\nENT:  Oropharynx is without erythema or exudate.\\nCARDIAC:  She has normal S1 and S2.\\nNo murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally at the bases.\\nABDOMEN:  Reveals normoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.\\nShe has no masses or organomegaly.\\nEXTREMITIES:  She has no cyanosis, clubbing, edema.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.\\nGrossly nonfocal exam.\\nPSYCHIATRIC:  She has normal mood and affect.\\nBREASTS:  She has a well-healed surgical incision over the right breast along with the right axilla.\\nShe has a well-healed incision over the left breast as well.\\nShe has no palpable masses or nodules on either breast.\\nLYMPH NODES:  She has no palpable cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary lymphadenopathy.\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mrs. Patient109 is a pleasant 66-year-old female with newly diagnosed multicentric breast cancer.\\nShe was found to have invasive tubular carcinoma on the right along with an encapsulated papillary carcinoma on the left in addition to ductal carcinoma in situ.\\nShe has now undergone resection of both lesions with clean margins after reexcision on the left.\\nWe discussed her diagnosis at length.\\nBoth of these lesions tend to be more benign than other forms of breast carcinoma.\\nHer papillary carcinoma was fully encapsulated.\\nShe did have ductal carcinoma in situ on the left breast.\\nWe do recommend bilateral breast radiation in her case.\\nWe also discussed the importance of taking Arimidex if she tolerates this.\\nWe did provide her with a prescription.\\nWe discussed side effects including worsening of hot flashes, arthralgias, and loss of bone density.\\nWe are particularly concerned loss of bone density in her given that she also just recently came off of her hormone replacement therapy.\\nWe will check a baseline DEXA scan.\\nWe also encouraged her to start taking calcium plus vitamin D.\\nWe will plan on following up with her in six to eight weeks, after she completes radiation.\\nShe is due to see Dr. Person29 for planning this afternoon.\\nEND OF DICTATED Person17 BY RESIDENT/Person20.\\nPerson4 MD COMMENT BELOW.\\nI saw and evaluated the patient, reviewed the resident\\'s/fellow\\'s note and agree with the documented findings and plan of care.\\nSee my additional note.\\nPatient has bilateral stage I, low grade invasive breast cancer.\\nShe has had bilateral segmental resection and right SNB which was

DIAGNOSES:  This is a 66-year-old female with bilateral breast cancer.\\n 1.\\nOn the right, she had a segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy for T1c N0 M0, stage I invasive tubular breast cancer, ER positive, HER-2 negative with a Ki-67 of 1%.\\nThe tumor was 1.1 cm.\\n 2.\\nOn the left, she had an encapsulated papillary carcinoma measuring 1.9 cm, which is a type of ductal carcinoma in situ.\\nShe had resection and then reexcision for clean margins.\\n\\n\\n CURRENT THERAPY:  She was on anastrozole from June 2013 until August 2013.\\n\\n\\n PRIOR THERAPY:  1.\\nBilateral breast radiation with Dr. Person6, completed in August 2013.\\n 2.\\nShe was on anastrozole from June 2013 until August 2013.\\nIt was discontinued secondary to hypertension, headaches, depression, and memory problems.\\n\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Calcium, hydrochlorothiazide, and lisinopril.\\n\\n\\n INTERIM HISTORY:  Ms. Patient109 presents today for routine followup and plan of care.\\nShe has been off of the Arimidex for approximately six weeks.\\nShe is feeling considerably better.\\nShe is no longer depressed, and her memory issues have improved.\\nShe saw her PCP this week, and her lisinopril has been decreased to 10 mg daily.\\nShe now only has occasional headaches.\\nOverall, she feels much better off of the Arimidex.\\n\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The remainder of her review of systems is negative.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Height 72 inches, weight 198, temperature 98, pulse 66, respiratory rate 18, blood pressure 131/70, O2 sat is 98.\\n

DIAGNOSIS:  A 66-year-old woman with recently diagnosed bilateral breast cancer.\\n\\n1.\\nOn the right, she had a segmental mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy for T1c N0 M0, stage I invasive tubular breast cancer, ER 300, PR 1,\\nKi-67 of 1%, HER-2 negative.\\nThis tubular invasive cancer was 1.1 cm.\\n2.\\nOn the left side, she had an encapsulated papillary carcinoma measuring 1.9 cm.\\nThis is in essence a type of ductal carcinoma in situ.\\nShe had resection and then reexcision to get clean margins.\\n\\nCURRENT THERAPY:  I started her on anastrozole in early June 2013 but she did not tolerate it and I will describe that below.\\nShe has just recently last week finished bilateral breast radiation under the direction of Dr. Person6.\\n\\nINTERIM HISTORY:  Unfortunately, the patient has had considerable problems since I saw her for her first visit with me in early June 2013.\\nShe has developed hypertension and her PCP, Dr. Person36 has started her on lisinopril.\\nShe complains of symptoms of tearfulness and possible depression.\\nShe had terrible myalgias and arthralgias one month after starting the Arimidex.\\nShe called into my office, and we advised her to stop the Arimidex and myalgias and arthralgias improved within 3-4 days.\\nShe describes a foggy sensorium in the sense that she is not thinking clearly.\\nShe reports that she put a pot on the stove without water in it.\\n\\nShe and her husband are under considerable amount of stress.\\nBoth of them are receiving radiation at the same time under the direction of Dr. Person6.\\nMs. Patient109 just finished bilateral breast radiation and her husband was getting prostate cancer radiation.\\nThey were driving in from 1.5 hours away each day for the radiation treatment.\\nThe stress of this has been overwhelming.\\nShe also complains of headaches located frontally and sometimes awakening her.\\nThese have waxed and waned over the past two months.\\nThey are slightly less since she has been off the Arimidex.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily, HCTZ 12.5 mg p.r.n. ankle edema, calcium and vitamin D.\\nShe stopped the Arimidex last month.\\n\\nCOMORBIDITIES:  She reports that she had rather significant skin reaction to the bilateral breast radiation and this is just beginning heal.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Performance status ECOG 1.\\nWeight 194, blood pressure 120/70, pulse 70.\\nSKIN:  Normal.\\nHEENT:  No jaundice.\\nLYMPH NODES:  None palpable.\\nLUNGS:  Clear.\\nHEART:  Regular.\\nBREASTS:  Bilateral segmental mastectomy.\\nGrade I skin reaction seems to be healing bilaterally.\\nNo palpable mass.\\nABDOMEN:  Normal.\\nEXTREMITIES:  Normal.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  Normal.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  1.\\nRight-sided T1c N0 M0 tubular invasive breast cancer with atypical lobular hyperplasia, ER positive, PR positive (70), HER-2 negative, Ki-67 of 1%.\\nStatus post lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, which was negative.\\nI put her on Arimidex, but she did not tolerate it as described above.\\n2.\\nShe has left encapsulated papillary carcinoma, which is a form of ductal carcinoma in situ along with atypical ductal hyperplasia.\\nShe has now completed radiation to both breasts.\\n3.\\nSymptoms of depression, headache, difficulty coping, myalgias, arthralgias with the Arimidex, which has been stopped.\\n4.\\nDEXA scan dated June 21, 2013, shows normal bone density.\\n\\nPLAN:  1.\\nI had a long discussion with her for approximately 25 minutes reviewing the excellent prognosis from both breast cancers.\\nWe discussed possible depression and poor tolerance to the Arimidex, we also discussed all the stress that she and her husband have been under having both of them receive simultaneous radiation for early stage cancers.\\n2.\\nI counseled her that her prognosis is excellent.\\nI am not overly concerned about the headaches at this time, although she requested an MRI brain.\\nI discussed that we should hold off on MRI brain and see how her symptoms go over the next month.\\nWe discussed referral to Behavioral Medicine for coping techniques, but she does not want to do that at this time.\\n3.\\nI will observe and keep her off the Arimidex at this point and ask her to come back in 4-6 weeks.\\nI think by that time she will feel improved overall as she moves out from the rigors of radiation.\\nAt that point, I will probably start her on an alternative aromatase inhibitor.\\n4.\\nShe asked if the Arimidex can cause hypertension, and I told her I do not think so.\\nI asked her to follow up with Dr. Person17 regarding hypertension.\\n5.\\nIn general, my counseling was about reassurance and she stated that it was helpful and I will see her again in six weeks.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson10, M.D.\\nClinical Professor of Person8\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person10, M.D. on 08/16/2013 at 03:45 PM\\n\\n\\nD:  08/16/2013 07:23AM,

The residual infiltrating lobular carcinoma was fairly extensive.\\nIn spite of the additional medial and posterior tissue resected, she has multiple persistently close margins.\\nIn addition, 9 of 11 lymph nodes were positive with extracapsular extension. Dr. Person50\\nrecommends a completion total mastectomy to reduce her risk of local recurrence.\\nPostmastectomy radiation therapy will likely be part of her treatment plan and therefore a delayed reconstruction is recommended.\\n 2.\\nThe risks and benefits of surgery were discussed.\\nShe understands the appearance of the incision with removal of the nipple areolar complex followed by JP drain placement.\\nThis procedure will be performed under a general anesthesia as inpatient surgery.\\nFollowing discharge, home care will be arranged to assist with JP drain care.\\nAfter removal of the JP drains, she understands physical therapy will be initiated to help with post operative stiffness from prior axillary lymph node dissection.\\n\\n3.\\nShe will undergo evaluation at the Pre-op center at Institution for an updated history and physical with bloodwork.\\nHer surgery is scheduled on 1/23/13 at Institution.\\n\\n4.\\nShe will be referred back to Dr. Person17 following her second surgery.\\nRadiation oncology referral will be coordinated postoperatively.\\n\\n 5.\\nShe will contacted the office when her drain output is less than 30 cc daily for drain removal.\\n\\n\\n

She has been on neoadjuvant Arimidex for approximately 4 months. At her last office visit, she was noted to have a partial response although a persistent palpable nodule was present in the periareolar 3:00 position.\\nShe reports that she has been compliant with her Arimidex. She is tolerating this without side effects. She also says that she stopped smoking yesterday.\\nHer past medical and surgical history, medications, allergies, family, and social history were reviewed and updated in the electronic health record.\\nComprehensive breast examination is performed with the patient sitting and recumbent. Her breasts are moderate in size and grossly symmetric.There is no erythema or edema of the breast skin. The right nipple is everted. The left nipple is slightly inverted, however, it is able to be everted with manipulation. There is a persistent palpable thickening in the 3:00 axis immediately adjacent to the base of the nipple. Palpation of the left breast is negative for mass or fibroglandular thickening. She has no left axillary infra-or supraclavicular adenopathy. The right breast is also without dominant mass or thickening. There is no right axillary infra-or supraclavicular adenopathy. She has a soft palpable mobile subcutaneous mass overlying the sternum. The clinical characteristics are consistent with a sebaceous cyst.\\nA diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were performed last week. Her mammogram showed a decrease in size and density of the spiculated mass in\\nthe outer left breast. A residual 1 cm mass was visible mammographically. Benign calcifications were noted. Ultrasound identified 2 masses in the 3:00 axis 1 cm and 3 cm from the nipple respectively. These measured 0.8 and 0.9 cm in greatest dimension and were not significantly different compared to her ultrasound in August. Ultrasound of the axilla showed no enlarged lymph nodes.\\nImpression: Partial response to neoadjuvant Arimidex for a stage II infiltrating lobular carcinoma with axillary node metastasis. There has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the breast over the last 2 months based on serial ultrasound examinations. She has had a partial response to treatment, however this response appears to have plateaued.\\nWe discussed proceeding with surgery. It is reasonable to proceed with breast conserving surgery. This would involve a wide excision of both biopsy sites along with a surrounding margin of normal tissue. I would recommend an axillary lymph node dissection since she had a biopsy proven positive axillary node at the time of initial diagnosis. Risks of axillary node dissection including but not limited to numbness and lymphedema were outlined. She understands that if negative margins are not obtained, additional surgery would be recommended. This could require either a re-excision or a completion total mastectomy. Adjuvant whole breast radiation will be recommended to reduce the risk of local recurrence.\\nWe also discussed the alternative of a total mastectomy. Rosemary strongly prefers breast conserving therapy if that is possible. Her surgery has been tentatively scheduled at Institution women's hospital on 12/5/12. She will continue on her Arimidex until her surgery.\\nShe was strongly advised to continue with her smoking cessation efforts to reduce her risk of perioperative pulmonary complications. She will contact her primary care physician if she needs a prescription smoking cessation\\na. She will be referred to the preop Center for a chest x-ray, EKG and labwork to assess her candidacy for general anesthesia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient174_report021_NOTE@gold', '4@e@patient174_report021_NOTE@gold', '6@e@patient174_report021_NOTE@gold', '7@e@patient174_report021_NOTE@gold', '8@e@patient174_report021_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex'], 'span': [[578, 586], [853, 861], [1090, 1098], [2739, 2747], [4008, 4016]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['3@e@patient174_report021_NOTE@gold', '5@e@patient174_report021_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['4 months', 'approximately 4 months'], 'span': [[589, 597], [866, 888]], 'id': [0, 1]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient174_report021_NOTE@gold', 'ment': '20121030', 'span': [230, 238]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report036_NOTE': {'raw_note': \"===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................1493,OpwivPs62euq\\nPatient ID....................OpwivPs62euq\\nPatient Name..................Patient174\\nPrincipal Date................20121214\\nRecord Type...................NOTE\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\nAttending addendum:  I have independently seen and examined the patient. I have discussed the case with the mid-level provider, reviewed the note, history and physical examination as documented by the mid-level provider, formulated the medical decision making, and agree with the documentation included for this visit. I have also assessed a 14 point review of systems which is positive as per the mid-level note and otherwise unremarkable. The patient's past medical history, past surgical history, medications, allergies, review of systems, and psychosocial history was independently reviewed as evidenced by my dated signatures on the electronic medical record created on the day of her office encounter.\\n\\n I have personally performed the medical decision making and would like to add:  Rosemary has an unusual case. We had treated her with neo-adjuvant Arimidex and on imaging, she had appeared to be responding. She recently went for surgery and was found to have extensive ILC measuring 6.5 cm, with 9/11 nodes +. I repeated the ER/PR on the tumor and nodes and this showed:  ER 160 in tumor, PR negative, her2 1+\\nER 210 in node, PR negative, Her2 2+, FISH\\n\\nHer initial node was ER 290, PR 150, Her2 was 2+\\nHer initial tumor was ER 300, PR 220, Ki67 5% and Her2 was 2+, and ER 300, and PR 200 in a 2nd biopsy. Both areas in the breast were sent for oncotype and this revealed scores of 3 and 16.\\n\\n\\n I think in light of her extensive nodal positivity, my bias is that chemotherapy in indicated now even though her oncotype was low. I am also concerned that her ER and PR levels in the residual tumor dropped, perhaps indicating selection of a more aggressive clone. I will discuss this at breast conference.\\n She needs to have additional surgery and will need XRT as well. I will discuss the timing of this at breast conference. The plan now is for surgery on 1/23 which will push back chemo to end of February.\\nI will restage her in the interim\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient174_report036_NOTE@gold', '3@e@patient174_report036_NOTE@gold', '4@e@patient174_report036_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['Arimidex', 'chemotherapy', 'chemo'], 'span': [[1271, 1279], [1887, 1899], [2305, 2310]], 'id': [0, 1, 2]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['5@e@patient174_report036_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['end of February'], 'span': [[2314, 2329]], 'id': [0]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient174_report036_NOTE@gold', 'ment': '20121214', 'span': [230, 238]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report046_HP': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................1165,8L6FkWEH3jK0\\nPatient ID....................8L6FkWEH3jK0\\nPatient Name..................Patient174\\nPrincipal Date................20130123 0000\\nRecord Type...................HP\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\n\\n*U*P*M*C* Patient174 Acct#:\\nInstitution of Institution\\nFamily Medicine\\nPreadmission History and Physical\\nPATIENT NAME:  Patient174\\nMRN:  \\nACCOUNT #:  \\nDATE OF BIRTH:  04/20/1945\\n/\\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  Person10\\nADMISSION DATE:\\nIDENTIFICATION:  The patient is a 67-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3,\\nover 20 years postmenopausal, who presents for medical clearance prior to\\nupcoming left mastectomy.\\nHISTORY:  The patient discovered a lesion in her left breast.

No S3, S4 murmur.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.\\nEXTREMITIES:  No edema, clubbing or cyanosis.\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\\n1.  Preoperative evaluation.  Rosemary is a pleasant 67-year-old female\\npatient with history of chest pain.  Her exercise tolerance is limited from\\narthritis.  Her EKG is normal sinus rhythm, no history of diabetes or\\nhyperlipidemia.  She has quit smoking.  No further cardiac testing\\nrecommended.  Her laboratories were reviewed.  Creatinine slightly elevated\\nat 1.3, BUN 34, sodium 132, chloride 92, calcium 10.5.  These are\\nsuggestive of dehydration.  We have recommended the patient stop her\\ndiuretic, which is Dyazide, increase fluid intake and recheck a CMP on\\nMonday, November 19.  Chest x-ray reveals no acute cardiopulmonary disease.\\nIf her creatinine is improving, she can proceed for the procedure as\\nplanned.  In case of worsening creatinine, may need IV hydration and\\nfurther workup.\\n2.  Hypertension.  Dyazide has been held.  Continue Norvasc and Cozaar.\\nShe will need to keep a watch on her blood pressure. Norvasc can be\\nincreased up to 10 mg.  She will call if her blood pressures are elevated.\\n3.  Breast cancer.  Continue Arimidex.\\nADDENDUM:\\nFollowup creatinine was done on the patient, which was 1.14.  The patient\\nis cleared for the upcoming procedure as planned.  No further testing\\nrecommended.\\n______________________________\\nElectronically authenticated at end of document.\\nDictated by: Person3, M.D.\\nD:  11/16/2012 01:56PM, AA T:  11/16/2012 03:39PM, maf  R: 12/05/2012 08:53AM\\nem Confirmation # 395875/ Document ID: \\nAuthenticated by Person3, MD On 12/14/2012 10:03:49 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient174_report022_HP@gold', '3@e@patient174_report022_HP@gold', '4@e@patient174_report022_HP@gold'], 'ment': ['Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex'], 'span': [[1000, 1008], [1647, 1655], [3680, 3688]], 'id': [0, 1, 2]}, 'time': {'ment_id': [], 'ment': [], 'span': [], 'id': []}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient174_report022_HP@gold', 'ment': '20121116', 'span': [230, 238]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report062_PGN': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................1179,8L6FkWEH3jK0\\nPatient ID....................8L6FkWEH3jK0\\nPatient Name..................Patient174\\nPrincipal Date................20130131 0704\\nRecord Type...................PGN\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\n\\nBreast Service Progress Note:\\n\\nInstitution\\n\\nPatient: Patient174 MRN:  FIN: \\nAge: 67 years Sex: Female DOB: 4/20/1945\\nAssociated Diagnoses: None\\nAuthor: Person57\\n\\nSubjective\\n\\nPost-Op Day\\n# 1.\\nincision and drainage left breast hematoma.\\n\\nStatus Post\\nMastectomy.\\n\\nNausea/Vomiting\\nDenies nausea/vomiting.\\n\\nPain Management/Pain Level\\nPain Well Managed.\\n\\nAmbulatory Status\\nOOB.\\n\\nDiet\\nSolids.\\n\\nPhysical Examination\\n\\nVital Signs (Last 7 in past 36 hours)\\n\\nVitals\\t TempC\\t BP\\t Pulse\\t RR\\t SaO2\\t FiO2\\n1/31 04:05\\t 36.6\\t 141/75\\t 84\\t 16\\t 94\\t 2 L/m\\n1/31 02:00\\t 36.6\\t 138/76\\t 82\\t 18\\t 96\\t 2 L/m\\n1/30 23:30\\t 36.6\\t 138/77\\t 85\\t 18\\t 95\\t 4 L/m\\n1/30 21:30\\t 36.1\\t 127/64\\t 88\\t 16\\t 97\\t 4 L/m\\n1/30 20:30\\t 36.3\\t 136/79\\t 90\\t 18\\t 94\\t 4 L/m\\n1/30 20:15\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t 4 L/m\\n1/30 20:00\\t\\t 155/54\\t 88\\t 21\\t 96\\n\\n24 Hr Max Temp: 36.6 at 01/31 04:05\\t Dosing Wt: 111 kg (As of 01:29:13 16:20)\\n36 Hr Max Temp: 36.6 at 01/31 04:05\\t BMI: 41.8 (As of 01:29:13 16:20)\\n\\nReview / Management\\nInpatient Meds :\\n\\nInpatient Medications\\n\\nScheduled Medications\\nbacitracin topical (Baciguent) 1Application Topically BID\\nPRN Medications\\nacetaminophen 650mg By Mouth Q4H\\nacetaminophen-oxycodone (Percocet 5/325) 1tab By Mouth Q4H\\nacetaminophen-oxycodone (Percocet 5/325) 2tab(s) By Mouth Q4H\\nondansetron (Zofran) 4mg IVP Q8H\\nzolpidem (Ambien) 10mg By Mouth AtBedtime\\nOne-Time Medications (Time shown is time ordered to be given.)\\n[Completed] cefazolin 2gm IV OnCallCPOE\\nFuture Medications\\n(Starting 1/31 09:00) amlodipine (Norvasc) 5mg By Mouth Daily\\n(Starting 1/31 09:00) anastrozole (Arimidex) 1mg By Mouth Daily\\n(Starting 1/31 09:00) losartan (Cozaar) 100mg By Mouth Daily\\nRecently Discontinued Medications\\ndexamethasone (Decadron) 4mg IV ONCE\\ndiphenhydrAMINE (Benadryl) 12.5mg IV Q15Min\\nfentanyl 25mcg IVP Q5Min\\nfentanyl 50mcg IVP Q5Min\\nmeperidine (Demerol HCl) 12.5mg IV Q15Min\\nnalbuphine (Nubain) 5mg IV Q15Min\\nondansetron (Zofran) 4mg IVP ONCE\\noxycodone 5mg By Mouth As DirCPOE\\nscopolamine Patch (Transderm-Scop) 1.5mg TransDerm ONCE\\nSCOPOLAMINE REMOVE PATCH Patch (Remove topical medication) 1ea Misc ONCE\\n\\n.\\n\\nLabs (Resulted in the Past 36 hours)\\n\\n1/31 4:15a\\t WBC\\t\\t 10.4\\t 1/31 4:15a\\t Neutrophils\\t H\\t 85\\t 1/30 2:18p\\t ABO/Rh\\nSecond..\\t\\t O Pos ...\\n1/31 4:15a\\t RBC\\t L\\t 3.51\\t 1/31 4:15a\\t Lymphs\\t L\\t 8\\t 1/30 2:18p\\t Specimen\\nExpi..\\t\\t 20130 ...\\n1/31 4:15a\\t Hgb\\t L\\t 10.7\\t 1/31 4:15a\\t Monocytes\\t\\t 4\\t 1/30 10:32a\\t ABO & Rh\\t\\t O\\nRh ...\\n1/31 4:15a\\t Hct\\t L\\t 31.4\\t 1/31 4:15a\\t Eosinophils\\t\\t 2\\t 1/30 10:32a\\t Antibody\\nScre..\\t\\t Negat ...\\n1/31 4:15a\\t MCV\\t\\t 89.5\\t 1/31 4:15a\\t Basophils\\t\\t 0\\t 1/30 10:32a\\t Specimen\\nExpi..\\t\\t 20130 ...\\n1/31 4:15a\\t RDW\\t\\t 14.5\\t 1/31 4:15a\\t Morphology Ob..\\t\\t Normal\\n1/31 4:15a\\t Platelets\\t H\\t 370\\t 1/30 5:06p\\t Bedside Hemog..\\t L\\t 8.4\\n\\nleft mastectomy -

Her initial office visit was on 6/1/12. Physical exam at that time was significant for a 4-5 cm area of fibroglandular thickening in the lateral 3:00 left breast associated with nipple retraction and a raised nodule in the 3:00 axis of the areola. Her mammogram demonstrated several spiculated masses in the 3:00 axis, largest measuring 1.4 cm, extending over a 4-5 cm area. Core biopsy of 2 sites revealed infiltrating lobular carcinoma. Biopsy of an abnormal left axillary lymph node was positive for metastatic carcinoma with extracapsular extension. It should be noted that her mammogram shows an indeterminate group of calcifications in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. At this point these calcifications have not been evaluated.\\n\\nShe was referred to Dr. Person6 for consideration of neoadjuvant hormone therapy to improve the likelihood of breast conservation. A CT scan of the chest abdomen and pelvis was performed and negative for metastatic carcinoma. A 2.1 cm right adrenal mass was identified and confirmed on MRI to be an adenoma. Bone scan was also negative. Oncotype DX testing was performed to confirm that she would not benefit from systemic chemotherapy. The Oncotype score was 16 consistent with a risk of distant recurrence of 10%.\\n\\nShe reports that she is compliant with the Arimidex although she is complaining of several side effects. She is having problems with insomnia. Dr. Person6 recommended melatonin which briefly helped, although she is again having difficulty sleeping. She also feels as if she has no energy\\nand that her legs are weak. She denies any hot flashes.\\n\\nThe remainder of her past medical and surgical history, medications, and allergies were reviewed and updated in the electronic health record.\\n\\nA comprehensive examination of the breasts was performed with the patient sitting and recumbent. Her breasts are moderate in size and grossly symmetric. There is no erythema or edema of the breast skin. The right nipple is everted. The left nipple is slightly inverted, however, it is able to be everted with manipulation. There is a persistent nodule palpable in the areolar skin 3:00 axis immediately adjacent to the base of the nipple. Palpation of the left breast is negative for mass or fibroglandular thickening. She has no left axillary infra-or supraclavicular adenopathy. The right breast is also without dominant mass or thickening. There is no right axillary infra-or supraclavicular adenopathy. She has a soft palpable mobile subcutaneous mass overlying the sternum. The clinical characteristics are consistent with a sebaceous cysts.\\n\\nStudies reviewed: An ultrasound of the left breast was performed in the breast care Center today. There is a persistent 0.8 cm hypoechoic nodule in the 3:00 axis 1 cm from the nipple. This corresponds to the index tumor which initially measured 1.4 cm. More laterally also at 3:00 is a 0.7 x 0.8 cm hypoechoic nodule. A third lesion that was identified at the time of diagnosis was not identified today. Ultrasound also confirmed a benign subcutaneous nodule overlying the sternum. Ultrasound characteristics are consistent with a sebaceous cyst.\\n\\nImpression: Partial clinical response to neoadjuvant Arimidex. Clinical breast exam is negative for dominant mass. She does have a persistent palpable nodule in the areolar skin. Ultrasound confirms a decrease in size of the dominant tumor.\\n\\nMy recommendation is to continue with 2 additional months of Arimidex. At\\nthat point a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound will be repeated. The calcifications in the left breast can be reevaluated and if necessary, stereotactic biopsy arranged. I reviewed with the patient the goal of achieving breast conserving surgery. She initially expressed an interest in total mastectomy, however, she understands that there would still be a risk of local or systemic recurrence following total mastectomy.

The patient was admitted to the\\nhospital and underwent mammography, CT scan, bone scan, and percutaneous\\nbiopsy of this mass.  The pathology revealed that this is adenocarcinoma.

I and Dr.\\nPerson12 had a long discussions with this patient regarding her current state.\\nAfter reviewing everything and then discussing with the patient, we felt\\nthat it was in her best interest to have this bleeding mass removed initially\\nfollowed by chemotherapy.

An elliptical incision was created removing this\\nentire palpable mass as well as the remaining portion of the breast tissue.\\nInferior and superior flaps were created in the skin.  The breast was taken\\noff the chest wall from the medial to lateral approach, leaving intact the\\npectoralis fascia.  A small amount of the left axillary fat pad was removed\\nwith the breast.  Hemostasis was controlled with 3-0 Vicryl sutures and Bovie\\nelectrocautery.  The specimen was marked.  In evaluating the specimen, the\\nclosest margin appeared to be the inferior margin.  I removed another section\\nof the inferior margin to ensure negative margins.  The area was irrigated.\\nThere was no evidence of bleeding.  A 19-French round drain was placed.  The\\nskin was closed with 3-0 Vicryl followed by 4-0 Vicryl.  Steri-Strips were\\napplied.  The patient then had a fluffed gauze and a Surgi-Bra applied.

As you\\nknow, but for the completion of our records, she is a 77-year-old female who\\npresented to the hospital with a history of a bleeding ulcer of the left breast\\nwhich had been present for 2-1/2 years.  This was biopsy proven as breast\\ncancer, and she underwent a left mastectomy on September 20, 2007.  The patient\\ntolerated this procedure well without complication.  She spent 2 days in the\\nhospital postoperatively for pain control, IV hydration, and JP care.  Since\\nshe has been discharged home, she has done very well and states that she has\\nnot needed to take any pain medication, and her drain output has decreased\\nsignificantly.  She had only 10 cc of serosanguineous fluid from the drain\\nyesterday.  She denies any swelling, numbness, or pain in the left upper\\nextremity.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Left breast cancer status post mastectomy.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  She takes no medications.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  AMOXICILLIN WHICH CAUSES DIARRHEA.\\n\\nSOCIAL/FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is a widow for the past 3 years.

All other systems have been reviewed\\nand are negative.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.8, pulse 72, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure\\n132/68, weight 165 pounds.\\nGENERAL:  She is alert and oriented x3 in no apparent distress.  Her pupils are\\nequal and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Sclerae are\\nanicteric.  There are no mucosal lesions.\\nNECK:  She has no palpable cervical adenopathy.  Her trachea is midline.\\nHEART:  Regular in rate and rhythm with a normal S1, S2 and no murmurs, rubs,\\nor gallops.\\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nCHEST:  Examination of her chest reveals a well-healing surgical scar over her\\nleft breast.  There is some prominence in the lateral aspect of the sternum;\\nhowever, there is no evidence of erythema or exudate.  Her JP drain revealed\\nserosanguineous fluid.  There are no signs or symptoms of infection.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.\\nEXTREMITIES:  She had full range of motion of all 4 extremities, and\\nparticularly the left upper extremity had no focal neurological deficits.\\nGU:  Deferred.\\nRECTAL EXAM:  Deferred.\\nPSYCHIATRIC:  Her mood and affect were appropriate.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Patient136 is a 77-year-old female status post a left\\nmastectomy for breast cancer.  She has done well in the postoperative period,\\nand her JP drain was removed in the office today.  Her incision appears to be\\nhealing well, and she has no complaints.

Last cycle on 5/9/13\\n\\nReason for visit: Assess response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\n\\nThe patient returns the office today for ongoing management of the above-referenced right breast cancer. She was initially seen in February after core biopsy of a palpable mass in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast was positive for triple negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Metastatic workup with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for metastasis.\\n\\nShe has now completed 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan. She did require one emergency room visit for constipation. She recently developed pain in her left breast. Dr. Person6 arranged for ultrasound of the left breast on 4/9/13. This was negative for underlying abnormalities. MRI of her breasts performed at the time of diagnosis also showed no underlying left breast pathology.\\n\\nHer past medical and surgical history, medications, allergies, family, and social history were reviewed and updated in the electronic health record.\\n\\nA comprehensive examination of the breasts was performed with the patient sitting and recumbent. Her breasts are moderate to large in size and grossly symmetric. There is no erythema or edema of breast skin. Nipples are normally everted without crusting or excoriation. Palpation of the right breast is negative for mass or fibroglandular thickening. She has no axillary, infra-, or supraclavicular adenopathy. Similarly, the left breast is without dominant mass or thickening. There is no left axillary, infra-, or supraclavicular adenopathy.\\nA targeted ultrasound of the right lower outer quadrant was performed in the office using the SonoSite. A 1.5 x 0.6 x 1.0 cm hypoechoic irregular mass associated with a biopsy clip is visualized in the 7:00 axis immediately superior to the inframammary crease. Images were obtained for documentation.\\n\\nImpression: 50-year-old postmenopausal woman with a clinical stage II (T2, N0, M0) triple negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast. She is completed 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan and has had a partial clinical response. The tumor is no longer palpable and has decreased in size based on ultrasound examination.\\n\\nGenetic testing was positive for a deleterious BRCA2 gene mutation. She is quite surprised at this finding as her family history is not strongly suggestive of a hereditary breast cancer. Her mother was in her 70s with her initial diagnosis. It is also interesting that she has a BRCA2 gene mutation and not a BRCA1 mutation given the phenotype of her tumor. She is questioning the validity of the results. I will confirm with our genetic counselors that testing was performed on the appropriate sample. [Confirmed that testing was performed in duplicate and results confirmed.]\\n\\nShe has been advised that she has a 2-3% per year risk of second breast cancer in the contralateral breast. We discussed at length options for breast cancer surveillance and risk reduction. Increased surveillance would involve supplementing her annual mammogram with annual bilateral breast MRI. The goal is early detection which lowers the probability of a node positive cancer. She has already undergone . It is not clear if she would derive a benefit from tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention. It would not provide her with risk reduction for a subsequent triple-negative breast cancer. However, it would lower the risk of estrogen receptor positive lesion.\\nShe also has the option of bilateral mastectomies. This would reduce her risk of breast cancer by 90-95%. Her initial reaction is that she is not interested in undergoing the surgery. However, she would like to meet with a plastic surgeon to better understand options for breast reconstruction.\\n\\nShe will be referred to our patient navigators to put her in touch with other patients who have elected prophylactic mastectomy. Her last chemotherapy is scheduled for August 1, 2013. She will followup in the office in mid August with a\\ndiagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI to assess her response. At that time we will finalize her surgical decision.\\n\\nTotal time spent with the patient was 30 minutes, greater than 50% was counseling and coordination of care.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', '3@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', '5@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', '6@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', '7@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', '8@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', '9@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', '10@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['Adriamycin', 'Cytoxan', 'chemotherapy', 'Adriamycin', 'Cytoxan', 'Adriamycin', 'Cytoxan', 'chemotherapy'], 'span': [[749, 759], [764, 771], [854, 866], [1288, 1298], [1303, 1310], [2812, 2822], [2827, 2834], [4644, 4656]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['4@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', '11@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['5/9/13', 'August 1, 2013'], 'span': [[797, 803], [4674, 4688]], 'id': [0, 1]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient117_report027_NOTE@gold', 'ment': '20130517', 'span': [229, 237]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report020_NOTE': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................682,PGowmpkYKYeY\\nPatient ID....................PGowmpkYKYeY\\nPatient Name..................Patient117\\nPrincipal Date................20130418\\nRecord Type...................NOTE\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\nPROGRESS NOTE\\nHISTORY & PHYSICAL\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Breast Cancer\\n\\nSUBJECTIVE: Patient117 is a 50 year old surgically postmenopausal female diagnosed with a right breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma, T2, N0, M0 which is ER negative , PR negative, and HER-2 negative.

Taxol x 4, last chemo 8/1/13\\nReason for visit: Assess response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\n The patient returns the office today for ongoing management of the above-referenced right breast cancer. She was initially seen in February after core biopsy of a palpable mass in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast was positive for triple negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Metastatic workup with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for metastasis. Her last office visit was on 5/17/13. The mass in the right breast was no longer palpable. Office based ultrasound demonstrated a residual 1.5 cm hypoechoic mass in the lower outer quadrant 7:00 position corresponding to the biopsy clip.\\nShe has now completed 4 cycles of Taxol. She tolerated this relatively well. She reports her energy level is rebounding. She required one emergency room visit secondary to constipation. She denied dose delays or dose reductions.\\n\\nHer past medical and surgical history, medications, allergies, family and social history are reviewed and updated in the electronic health record.\\nExamination: A comprehensive examination of the breasts is performed with the patient sitting and recumbent. Her breasts are large and pendulous. There are grossly symmetric. There is no erythema or edema of breast skin and the nipples are normally everted. Palpation of the right breast is negative for discrete mass or fibroglandular thickening. She has no axillary, infra-, or supraclavicular adenopathy. Left breast is also\\nwithout dominant mass or thickening. There is no left axillary, infra-, or supra-clavicular adenopathy.\\nStudies reviewed: Post-chemotherapy breast imaging was completed on 8/9/13. Mammogram demonstrates a decrease in size of the mass from maximum of 2.4 cm to 2.1 cm. Ultrasound demonstrates a vague, hypoechoic lesion measuring 1.2 x 1.3 cm. Her MRI also shows a partial imaging response. There is a residual 1.1 x 1.9 x 1.2 cm mass with decreased enhancement. No new abnormalities are noted in the right breast or the contralateral left breast. There has been resolution of the edema and skin thickening.\\nImpression: Partial clinical response to primary systemic chemotherapy for a triple negative right breast cancer. By all imaging modalities, there has been substantial reduction in tumor volume. The patient is motivated to undergo breast conserving surgery. We discussed that with a BRCA2 gene mutation, her risk of a contralateral breast cancer is 2-3% per year for approximately 20-30% over the next 10 years. Her current breast cancer is triple negative. Although the majority of tumors that develop in BRCA2 mutation carriers are ER positive, in the setting of a personal history of triple-negative breast cancer, it is not clear that tamoxifen will be effective for breast cancer risk reduction. I reviewed with her the option of bilateral risk reducing mastectomies which have been shown to reduce breast cancer risk by 90-95%. She verbalized good understanding regarding her risk of breast cancer as well as the possible need for additional treatment if metachronous\\nbreast cancer is identified. However, at this time, she is not emotionally or physically prepared to undergo a bilateral mastectomy surgery. She prefers to proceed with segmental excision and sentinel node biopsy.\\n\\n She will be scheduled for right segmental mastectomy with seed localization, sentinel node biopsy, possible axillary node dissection in\\nearly September. Her annual imaging will need to include mammography as well as bilateral breast MRI. Total time spent with the patient was 30 minutes, more than 90% was in counseling and coordination of care.\\n\\n\\n$&\\nPatient is aware of obesity and declines further counseling.\\n$!\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold', '3@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold', '4@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold', '6@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold', '7@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold', '8@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold', '9@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold', '10@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['Adriamycin', 'Cytoxan', 'Taxol', 'chemotherapy', 'Taxol', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'tamoxifen'], 'span': [[750, 760], [765, 772], [784, 789], [862, 874], [1533, 1538], [2431, 2443], [2969, 2981], [3550, 3559]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['5@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['8/1/13'], 'span': [[806, 812]], 'id': [0]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient117_report045_NOTE@gold', 'ment': '20130816', 'span': [229, 237]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report009_NOTE': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................675,PGowmpkYKYeY\\nPatient ID....................PGowmpkYKYeY\\nPatient Name..................Patient117\\nPrincipal Date................20130220\\nRecord Type...................NOTE\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\nPROGRESS NOTE\\nHISTORY & PHYSICAL\\n\\nSUBJECTIVE: Patient117 is a 50 year old postmenopausal female referred to the Institution by Dr. Person6.

She became anxious about her risk of a second breast cancer based on her BRCA2 gene mutation which was estimated to be 2-3% per year or approximately 20-30% over the next 10 years. She was also counseled that she has a risk of her current breast cancer recurring. However, for an early-stage triple-negative breast cancer with a good response to chemotherapy, her disease-free survival is estimated to be 85-90%.\\n The patient decided to undergo plastic surgery consultation with Dr. Person50 La Person17 on 8/22/13 to explore breast reconstructive options.\\nAt this point she feels comfortable pursing bilateral total mastectomy, right sentinel lymph node biopsy with possible axillary lymph node dissection with immediate reconstruction utilizing tissue expanders.\\nShe returns to the\\noffice to discuss the surgical procedure and sign consent.\\n\\n\\nThe Review of Systems was reviewed on the patient information sheet and electronic chart, and otherwise the Review of Systems is negative.\\n\\n\\nThe patient's Medications, Allergies, Past Medical, Surgical and Family Histories were reviewed and remain unchanged from prior visit on 8/16/13.\\n\\n\\nAssessment and Plan:  Patient117 is a pleasant 50 year old female with a Clinical Stage II (T2, N0, M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast, triple negative and documented deleterious BRCA 2 gene mutation.\\nDr. Person6 recommended a right total mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy and possible axillary lymph node dissection and left prophylactic total mastectomy. The patient is interested in immediate breast reconstruction utilizing tissue expanders.\\n\\n The surgical procedure was reviewed in great detail. I explained the anticipated appearance of the incision with removal of the nipple-areolar complex and drain placement. That the axilla is clinically and radiographically negative and she is a candidate for sentinel node staging.\\n I reviewed the use of radioisotope and dye to map the location of the sentinel lymph node.\\nProvided the sentinel node is negative for metastatic carcinoma, no further axillary node dissection would be recommended.\\nIf the sentinel node was positive for metastatic carcinoma, further recommendations would be made regarding additional axillary surgery.\\n\\n\\nShe will obtain a history and physical with labwork coordinated by Dr. Person50 La Person17's office.

She was\\nfirst diagnosed about 1-1/2 years ago with a sizable left breast tumor that had\\nspread to 7 lymph glands. This was initially diagnosed down at Institution and it was recommended she follow up at Location Regional Health System.\\nTherefore she went to see Dr. Person12.  He administered chemotherapy to her and\\nfollowed this up with radiation to the left lumpectomy site and then\\nsubsequently has been treated with Arimidex which she continues on at the\\ncurrent time. She had started developing some pain in the right hip dating back\\nfor several weeks and she had an x-ray, then followed by a MR which showed an\\nerosive lesion in the right hip. She has not seen Dr. Person12 yet but apparently a\\nfew days ago, she tripped and fell and then again at work on the day of\\nadmission, she tripped and fell with a snapping of the right hip region.  She\\nwas brought into the hospital where she was noted to have an acute fracture and\\nunderwent unipolar hemiarthroplasty of the right proximal femur. It was felt to\\nbe a pathologic fracture. Pathology is as of yet pending.  Because of the\\nsuspicion that this is a pathological fracture, we were asked to comment.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for breast cancer as detailed above, status\\npost mastectomy and radiation done by Dr. Person14.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is married.  Does not smoke or drink.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: Negative for breast cancer.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No weight loss, change in appetite. No coughing, shortness\\nof breath or chest pains. No abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation. No blood\\nin stool or urine. No headaches or difficulty walking. No rash or nodules are\\nnoted.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\n\\nVITAL SIGNS: Temperature 100.2o, pulse 85, respirations 18, blood pressure\\n98/65.\\n\\nGENERAL: Well-appearing woman who is in no acute distress.\\n\\nHEENT: Unremarkable. No lesions of the eyes or mouth.\\n\\nNECK: Supple. No palpable lymph glands.\\n\\nCHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion.\\n\\nCARDIAC: Regular rhythm without S3 or murmur.\\n\\nABDOMEN: Soft, nontender. There is no palpable hepatosplenomegaly. No masses\\nare noted.\\n\\nBREASTS: Left implant but no masses are noted. Right breast shows a periareolar\\nscar. No direct masses are noted.  Axillary exam is negative bilaterally.\\n\\nEXTREMITIES: Deep venous thrombosis prophylactic devices, slight lymphedema on\\nthe left arm.\\n\\nNEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented x3. No gross motor or sensory deficits.\\n\\nSKIN: Without rash, petechiae or ecchymoses.\\n\\nLABORATORY: White blood cell count 13.1, hemoglobin 12.5, platelets 240,000,\\nBUN 14, creatinine 0.7. Liver function tests all within normal limits.  Chest\\nx-ray shows no acute findings.\\n\\nIMPRESSION: Metastatic breast cancer with bone metastasis.\\n\\nThe patient has now had surgery and depending on the pathology, she may need\\nfurther radiation. I am concerned she may have other metastatic deposits,\\ntherefore a bone scan will be ordered by myself that she can have when she is\\nallowed to get out of bed. This will look not only at the hip but at the rest\\nof her bones. I think that she is high risk of having other metastatic disease.\\nI have also recommended that she have CT evaluation of the chest, abdomen and\\npelvis looking for visceral disease since she will need a change in her\\ntreatment. This is obviously progressing through the Arimidex and therefore she\\ncould to go a second hormonal treatment if the only thing she has is bone\\ndisease but if she has visceral disease, further chemotherapy would be\\nrecommended. It is unknown whether she is HER-2 positive or negative and this\\nmay help guide the choice of treatment. I have also recommended that she be\\nconsidered for a\\nbisphosphonate to reduce the chances of skeletal related events and maybe\\ndiminish the changes of pathological fracture.  Dr. Person47 will pick her up\\nas of Tuesday and we will await the pathology.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson441.\\n\\nD:   09/03/2006/ 2:07 P\\nT:   09/04/2006  7:27 A ec\\n#/\\n\\ncc:  Person3, D.O.\\nPerson23, D.O.\\nPerson441.\\nPerson442, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient123_report032_HP@gold', '3@e@patient123_report032_HP@gold', '5@e@patient123_report032_HP@gold', '6@e@patient123_report032_HP@gold'], 'ment': ['chemotherapy', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'chemotherapy'], 'span': [[888, 900], [1016, 1024], [3883, 3891], [4033, 4045]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['4@e@patient123_report032_HP@gold'], 'ment': ['current time'], 'span': [[1055, 1067]], 'id': [0]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient123_report032_HP@gold', 'ment': '20060903', 'span': [230, 238]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report014_LETT': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................1987,pnAi8q88lnwR\\nPatient ID....................pnAi8q88lnwR\\nPatient Name..................Patient123\\nPrincipal Date................20031208\\nRecord Type...................LETT\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\n\\nPerson16, DO\\n33 North\\nPost Office Box 704\\nLocation, PA \\n\\n\\nCC\\nPerson46, MD\\nInstitution\\n\\nLocation, PA \\n\\nPerson18, DO\\n\\n\\nLocation, PA \\n\\nPerson77, MD\\n\\nLocation, PA \\n\\nDear Dr. Person21:\\n\\nPatient123 returns to see me today for a first postsurgical visit after\\nskin-sparing total mastectomy and immediate reconstruction performed at\\nInstitution November 7, 2003.

EKG was obtained and show no evidence of acute disease and was\\nconsistent with previous EKG, taking this into account and patient's age, ACS\\nunlikely. The uterus appeared normal on imaging, and patient has no\\nhypertension, therefore dissection unlikely. No evidence of pneumothorax on\\nimaging. No evidence of pneumonia. Given this, I do not believe that the\\npatient's pain represents a life-threatening etiology. Patient reported that\\nher pain was slightly improved after getting Percocet. Therefore, she'll be\\nsymptomatically managed. She was instructed to followup with her PCP regarding\\nthis episode. Given her lung nodule, we are concerned for possible metastatic\\ndisease.

I reviewed their note and agree unless noted below\\nHPI: Patient is a 32-year-old female with history of breast cancer who\\npresents to the emergency department for evaluation of upper back pain and\\nshortness of breath that began acutely this morning. Patient notes that she is\\nhaving shortness of breath with exertion as well as sharp stabbing pain in her\\nupper back between her shoulders. Pain is not worse with movement. She is\\nconcerned about a blood clot given her cancer history. She has never had a\\nhistory of DVT or PE, did not have any lower extremity swelling or recent\\nimmobilization. She denies any fevers, chills, hemoptysis, nausea, abdominal\\npain, or frank chest pain.

Extremities\\nnon-edematous, symmetric. Skin is warm, well perfused, without rash. Clear\\nspeech and gait.\\nDiagnostic studies included EKG which shows normal sinus rhythm, normal axis\\nand intervals, no ST segment elevations or depressions, she does have T wave\\nflattening in the precordial leads, otherwise no abnormalities. Labs included\\nCBC, BMP, coags are unremarkable.\\nMDM: A CT scan was ordered to rule out pulmonary embolism given the patient's\\nhistory of cancer, this was negative for PE or other acute pulmonary findings\\nhowever there was report of a nodule that increase in size since last PET scan.\\nThis was communicative the patient and she will discuss it with her oncologist.\\nAfter testing was obtained patient reports she is relieved that she does not\\nhave a blood clot.

Today we discussed that:  1.\\nShe will continue to follow with medical oncologist for treatment as indicated. The plan is for further systemic therapy possibly with gemzar and carboplatinum after surgery.\\n2. The conduct of a segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. We have signed consents for surgery today.\\n3. She may also require radiation therapy to her left breast and axilla after surgery and chemotherapy are completed.\\n4. The cosmetic outcome of the breast following surgery and radiation therapy. I have expressed concern that there would be disparity in her breast size after her surgery. She understands and is agreeable to this. She still does not feel psychologically prepared to make any decisions regarding risk reducing surgery at this point, even in light of her BRCA results.\\n5. I have reassured her that the decision regarding risk reducing surgery\\nis not necessary at this point in time. I am not inclined to offering her prophylactic mastectomy or reconstruction at this point considering her progression of disease. I have told her that we will first complete the treatment of her recurrent breast cancer before making any decisions regarding prophylaxis or reconstruction in the future.\\n6. I have also ordered a staging PET/CT scan prior to her operation.\\n7. Pre op testing in the form of the CBC, BMP, chest x-ray and EKG will be scheduled within 30 days of surgery date.\\n\\nPatient126 understands everything we have discussed today and reports that all her questions have been answered. I have spent 40 minutes with her, her husband and her new baby today, the majority of time spent in counseling and coordination of care.\\nThank you for involving me in her care.

BMP and CBC unremarkable. Normal white count. Coags normal. EKG obtained and interpretation above. CT of chest was obtained that was negative for pulmonary embolism. However, there was evidence of slightly enlarged nodule in the lung compared to previous imaging one year ago. Patient was told that she does not have pulmonary embolism, but was informed of the nodule. She was instructed to followup with her oncologist. She was also instructed to followup with her PCP regarding her pain. Patient was given a prescription for 12 Percocet. Patient was then discharged from the emergency department in stable condition.\\n\\n\\nRESIDENT Person20:  34-year-old female comes in with acute onset upper\\nback pain and shortness of breath. Given her history of cancer, we are concerned pulmonary embolism. CT of chest was obtained with no evidence of pulmonary embolism. EKG was obtained and show no evidence of acute disease and was consistent with previous EKG, taking this into account and patient's age, ACS unlikely. The uterus appeared normal on imaging, and patient has no hypertension, therefore dissection unlikely. No evidence of pneumothorax on imaging. No evidence of pneumonia. Given this, I do not believe that the patient's pain represents a life-threatening etiology. Patient reported that her pain was slightly improved after getting Percocet. Therefore, she'll be symptomatically managed. She was instructed to followup with her PCP regarding this episode. Given her lung nodule, we are concerned for possible metastatic disease. Therefore she was instructed to follow up with her oncologist. Patient was hemodynamically stable here she was no longer tachycardic upon revaluation. Patient had normal oxygen saturations.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient126 is a 32 year old female with a new diagnosis of a left breast invasive ductal carcinoma that is triple negative. The patient self palpated a mass and presented to her obstetrician since she is pregnant. The obstetrician then sent her for an ultrasound which showed a hypoechoic mass. She then underwent a mammogram which showed an approximately 3.5 cm mass in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. This was subsequently biopsied, and proven to be an invasive ductal carcinoma that was triple negative. The patient is here to discuss neoadjuvant treatment.\\nThe plan for Ms. Patient126 is to undergo a baseline echocardiogram.\\n\\nThe patient will begin chemotherapy in approximately 2 weeks after she enters her second trimester. Her chemotherapy will initially be Adriamycin and Cytoxan every 3 weeks x4 treatments. This will then be followed by weekly Taxol x12.\\n\\nSide effects and management of chemotherapy were discussed with the patient and her husband.\\n\\n\\nDictated by Person7, CRNP.\\nPatient126 is in agreement to proceed with this plan as stated.\\nTime spent face to face with the patient was sick minutes, total counseling time was 55 minutes.\\nDuring that time, all of the patients questions were answered in detail.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold', '4@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold', '5@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold', '8@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold', '9@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['chemotherapy', 'Adriamycin', 'Cytoxan', 'Taxol', 'chemotherapy'], 'span': [[6472, 6484], [6584, 6594], [6599, 6606], [6673, 6678], [6716, 6728]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['3@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold', '6@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold', '7@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['in approximately 2 weeks', 'every 3 weeks', 'weekly'], 'span': [[6485, 6509], [6607, 6620], [6666, 6672]], 'id': [0, 1, 2]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient126_report010_NOTE@gold', 'ment': '20121116', 'span': [228, 236]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report074_RAD': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................1886,6hzOyXc/J7QW\\nPatient ID....................6hzOyXc/J7QW\\nPatient Name..................Patient126\\nPrincipal Date................20130705 0907\\nRecord Type...................RAD\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\n\\nCLINICAL HISTORY:\\n32-year-old female with history of triple negative invasive ductal\\ncarcinoma of the left breast, nuclear grade 3.

Patient126\\nPATIENT ID#: \\nDATE OF BIRTH: 08/29/1980\\nDATE OF VISIT: 04/15/2014\\n\\n\\nClinical Follow-Up Note\\n\\n\\n\\nDIAGNOSIS:  Breast cancer.\\n\\n\\n ICD-9 CODE:  174.2.\\n\\n\\n INTERVAL HISTORY:  Mrs. Patient126 returns today for a routine followup appointment and discussion.\\nI initially saw her in consultation on August 7, 2013.\\nShe had been diagnosed with T1c N0, triple negative, high-grade ductal carcinoma of the left breast during pregnancy.\\nShe underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC x4 followed by 12 cycles of Taxol.\\nDuring the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient noticed an interval increase in her palpable mass and imaging confirmed that it had approximately doubled in size.\\nPET/CT was negative for metastasis, but it confirmed the mammographic findings of local tumor progression.\\n\\n\\n On July 10, 2013, the patient underwent a segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.\\nFinal pathology showed a 4.3 cm, nuclear grade III invasive ductal carcinoma with an incomplete response to chemotherapy.\\nMargins were negative and there was no lymphovascular invasion.\\nAdditional margins were negative as well as 4 lymph nodes.\\nThe tumor contained focal areas with metaplastic changes including chondroid matrix formation and spindle cells.\\nThe patient then received adjuvant Gemzar and carboplatin for 4 cycles, which she completed in January of 2014.\\nIn the interim, genetic testing revealed a deleterious BRCA1 mutation and the patient therefore elected for bilateral mastectomies.\\nOn March 19, 2014, bilateral total mastectomy was done and pathology was negative for malignancy.\\n\\n\\n The patient has returned for discussion of radiotherapeutic options.\\n\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her arm mobility remains limited and she has some discomfort within the surgical sites, particularly on the left.\\nShe denies new masses on the chest wall, pulmonary difficulties or bony pain.\\nThe remainder of the review of systems is negative.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Reveals a young white female in no acute distress.\\n VITAL SIGNS:  She is 66 inches tall.\\nWeighs 323 pounds, BMI is 52, temperature is 98.1, pulse is 86, respirations are 20, blood pressure is 128/90.\\n NEUROLOGIC:  She is grossly nonfocal.\\n NECK:  Has no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.\\n LUNGS:  Clear bilaterally.\\n HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\\n BREASTS:  Surgically absent bilaterally and mastectomy scars are healing nicely and there is no evidence of chest wall recurrence or axillary adenopathy bilaterally.\\n ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.\\n EXTREMITIES:  Upper extremities have no visible lymphedema and left arm mobility is limited.\\n\\n\\n ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Patient126 is a 33-year-old woman who initially underwent a segmental mastectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for T2 N0 triple negative basal phenotype carcinoma with metaplastic features.\\nShe was switched to second line chemotherapy and subsequent mastectomy showed no residual disease.\\n\\n\\n Her case is a borderline one with regard to recommendation of postmastectomy radiation therapy.\\nI reviewed the case with my partner, Dr. Person6.\\nThe worrisome risk features include progression through chemotherapy, and high-grade triple negative with metaplastic features in premenopausal patient.\\nHer risk of recurrence without radiation is likely 10% to 15%.\\nI discussed the option of postmastectomy radiation therapy versus observation with the patient.\\nThe patient would like to be as aggressive as possible, even if the absolute benefit is not as large.\\nWe discussed the option of chest wall radiation therapy.\\nThe treatment course and potential side effects were discussed including skin reaction, more difficult reconstruction, rib fracture, lung inflammation and/or\\nscarring, heart disease, and second malignancy.\\nThe patient indicated she understood the treatment plan and risks and wished to proceed.\\nShe and her husband had an opportunity to have all of their questions answered.\\n\\n\\n For convenience sake, Mrs. Patient126 would like to be referred to Institution.\\nTherefore, we will make a referral to Dr. Person50.\\nWe are recommending post-mastectomy chest wall radiation followed by a boost to the scar.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson3, M.D.\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person3, M.D. on 04/17/2014 at 01:16 PM\\n\\n\\nD:  04/15/2014 03:33PM, MLH\\nT:  04/16/2014

Patient126\\nPATIENT ID#: \\nDATE OF BIRTH: 08/29/1980\\nDATE OF VISIT: 04/18/2014\\n\\n\\nConsultation\\n\\nREFERRING PHYSICIANS:  Dr. Person29, Dr. Person93, Dr. Person33, Dr. Person75, Dr. Person86, and Dr. Person96 La Person92\\n\\n\\n DIAGNOSIS:  Invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T2 N0 M0, stage IIA, grade III triple negative.\\n\\n\\n REASON FOR CONSULTATION:  I was asked to see Mrs. Patient126 in outpatient consultation for discussion of external beam radiation therapy as part of the treatment for her recently diagnosed stage IIA invasive ductal carcinoma.\\n\\n\\n NARRATIVE:  Mrs. Patient126 is a 33-year-old woman who felt a palpable breast mass in November 2012, at which point she was approximately 9-10 weeks pregnant.\\nShe stated the mass rapidly grew in size.\\nAn ultrasound was performed of the mass revealing a lesion 1.8 cm in greatest dimension at 10 o'clock in the left breast as well as a suspicious-appearing enlarged axillary lymph node.\\nUltrasound-guided core biopsy ensued assessing both lesions.\\nAxillary lymph node was negative for malignancy; however, the breast mass was positive for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, ER/PR negative, HER-2/neu negative with a very high Ki-67 of greater than 95%.\\nMultiple markers were tested and cytokeratin 5 confirmed the basal-like phenotype.\\nAs a result, she saw Dr. Person11 in consultation and it was decided she would begin neoadjuvant chemotherapy during her second trimester of pregnancy.\\nShe received 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 12 cycles of Taxol.\\nThis was completed on June 26th.\\nShe was also found to have a BRCA1 mutation.\\nPer extended discussion, it appeared that her lesion did significantly enlarge throughout chemotherapy as was felt on clinical exams.\\nMammogram then revealed the lesion did increase in size to around 4 cm and PET/CT scan confirmed no metastatic disease.\\nShe then had multiple discussions with the medical team at Institution about treatment options, including mastectomy, especially with her diagnosis of a BRCA mutation.\\nHowever, due to concern of the rapid progressive nature of her disease both clinically and with the Ki-67, she underwent a left-sided segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy on June 8, 2013.\\nPathology confirmed that her lesion did increase to 4.3 cm size, invasive ductal carcinoma, grade III, negative margins, no LVSI, and again triple negative.\\nShe then underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with Gemzar and carboplatin for 4 cycles from September to January 3, 2014.\\nDue to her BRCA1 mutation, she underwent bilateral total mastectomies on March 19, 2014.\\nPathology from this was negative.\\nShe also saw Dr. Person97 La Person92 from Plastic Surgery and the plan was to do reconstruction after any potential radiation therapy.\\nShe met with my colleague, Dr. Person29 at Person47 for discussion of radiation therapy as well.\\n\\n\\n She is now in my office for continued discussion of radiation therapy for her stage IIA triple-negative breast cancer, status post mastectomy.\\n\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her biggest complaint thus far has been severely decreased range of motion in her left upper extremity.\\nFor this, she started physical therapy and has had 3 sessions thus far.\\nShe does have some bruising around here from manual manipulation of her left shoulder.\\nShe also describes there is a tightness across the chest wall.\\nShe is taking 1 Aleve daily for this.\\nShe also has tightness in both upper arms.\\nHer chest wall incisions are well healing.\\nShe has no complaints regarding those at this point.\\nShe denies any erythema, fevers, chills or sweats.\\nShe does have continued neuropathy in her hands and feet bilaterally, but this has nearly completely resolved.\\nOtherwise, all systems reviewed and are negative.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Gestational diabetes, migraines, depression, multiple abnormal Paps since 2005, left breast cancer per HPI, seasonal allergies, morbid obesity.\\n\\n\\n PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had a dental manipulation, mastectomy per HPI.\\n\\n\\n GYNECOLOGIC HISTORY:  She took oral contraceptives for 13 years.\\nShe has been pregnant once and has given birth once.\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  ADHESIVE TAPE.\\n\\n\\n FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father had skin cancer, mother had colon cancer, paternal grandmother had lung cancer, paternal grandfather had prostate cancer.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a past smoker, smoking a half pack per day for 10 years, giving her a 5 pack year history.\\nShe drinks alcohol occasionally.\\n\\n\\n MEDICATIONS:  Aleve, multivitamin, Singulair, Prilosec, Zoloft, Claritin, Colace.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Height 66, weight 233, BMI 37.6, temperature 97.6, pulse 64, respirations 18, blood pressure 102/62.\\nKPS 90%.\\n GENERAL:  The patient is alert and oriented x3, in no acute distress.\\nShe appears her stated age.\\n HEENT:  Reveals a normocephalic, atraumatic cranium with no alopecia.\\nExtraocular muscles are intact and pupils are equally round and reactive to light and accommodation.\\nCranial nerves II through XII are intact grossly.\\nTrachea is midline.\\n NECK:  Supple.\\n LYMPH NODES:  I could not make out any cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy bilaterally, though her body habitus is somewhat limiting my exam.\\n CARDIOVASCULAR:  Reveals a regular rhythm and rate.\\nPositive S1, S2.\\nNo murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\\n LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\n BACK:  Reveals no pain with firm palpation of the spine.\\n BREASTS AND AXILLAE:  Bilateral chest wall examination reveals 2 horizontal intact scars from her mastectomies.\\nBoth are clean, dry, intact with no sign of infection or suspicious nodularity or sign of\\nrecurrence throughout.\\nBilateral axillary exam was performed, but again is limited due to her body habitus.\\nI could not make out any suspicious lymphadenopathy.\\nBilateral arm range of motion is significantly decreased.\\nHer left arm appears to be tight in the anterior shoulder musculature tracing down into the chest.\\nHer tendons within the axilla did not appear to me to be excessively tight though at most there is mild cording.\\nHer mastectomy wound does run very laterally along the chest wall and there is significant amount of excess tissue here due to her habitus.\\n ABDOMINAL:  Exam is limited due to the size of her abdomen, but I could not make out any hepatosplenomegaly.\\n EXTREMITY:  Reveals no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.\\nThere is no pain with firm palpation of all 4 extremities.\\nThere is no calf tenderness, nor is there Homans sign.\\n NEUROMUSCULAR:  Reveals 5/5 strength throughout with no focal neurologic deficits.\\nGait is normal as well.\\n\\n\\n IMAGING DATA:  Per HPI.\\nPET scan on July 5, 2013, was reviewed at length.\\nThere is a 4.4 x 4.3 cm mass in the left breast corresponding to her known carcinoma with highly significant FDG uptake with a maximum SUV of 40.1.\\nNo other additional uptake was seen.\\n\\n\\n Pathology per HPI.\\nMargins are widely negative and the closest margin was 1.8 cm.\\n\\n\\n ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mrs. Patient126 is a 33-year-old woman who was found to have a stage IIA triple-negative breast cancer during her first trimester of pregnancy.\\nShe was treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation via Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide followed by Taxol during her second trimester.\\nThis lesion appeared to have clinically and radiologically progressed during treatment.\\nShe then underwent lumpectomy followed by bilateral mastectomy due to the fact that she is BRCA1 positive.\\nThis treatment was followed up with adjuvant Gemzar and carboplatin for 4 more\\ncycles.\\nI had a very long and involved discussion with the patient and her husband regarding radiation therapy at this point.\\nWith her presentation, it is somewhat controversial as to whether she would benefit from radiation therapy to the chest wall.\\nHowever, due to her young age, high-grade tumor, and the fact that not only did she poorly respond to chemotherapy, but actually progressed throughout treatment, this would place her at an elevated risk of recurrence within the chest wall.\\nThese factors would not place her at an exceedingly high risk of harboring microscopic disease within the supraclavicular area or the axilla as this was addressed.\\nI am somewhat concerned that she only underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy not full axillary dissection; however, her pathologic findings do not necessarily place her at an increased risk for treatment to the axilla.\\nThat being said, I will treat with radiation therapy to her chest wall and I will contour out her axilla to assess coverage of this area.\\nOftentimes, coverage of the lower axilla is adequate simply with high tangents.\\nI will likely incorporate this strategy in my treatment plan.\\nI had a long discussion with her and her husband stating that this treatment would be to decrease risk of local recurrence only, but studies have shown this can lead to a benefit in survival.\\nI stated the side effects of radiation therapy include, but are not limited to skin erythema and breakdown, fibrosis of the skin limiting the ability to perform reconstructive surgery, lymphedema, decreased arm mobility, lung damage, heart damage, coronary artery disease, decreased cell counts, rib damage, secondary malignancy, decreased cosmesis.\\nI stated all of these side effects may be increased due to her body habitus and also due to her young age.\\nI stated we would likely treat to around 30-35 total fractions\\ndepending on her planning CT scan.\\nAt this point, I do not believe we can adequately get her arm over her head, so I recommended she continue intense physical therapy and we will attempt to do this in approximately 1-2 weeks.\\nAt that point, if she is unable to raise her arm, we will figure out the best way to begin her treatment plan.\\n\\n\\n At the end of our very long and involved consultation, all of her and her husband's questions were answered at length.\\nShe will be calling me in 1 week to let me know of her progress with physical therapy.\\nAt that point, she may come in for CT simulation or would wait 1 week after that if there are still issues.\\n\\n\\n Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the multidisciplinary care of this patient.\\nPlease contact me with any issues or concerns.\\n\\n\\n

de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\\nPatient126 is a pleasant 33 year old caucasian premenopausal woman who presents in office today in continuing management for a left breast cancer. I have been involved in Patient126\\'s care since November of 2012 for a left triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma, Stage IIA (T2,N0,M0) who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the form of Adriamycin Cytoxan and Taxotere under the direction of Dr. Person6. At the end of this treatment, Patient126 delivered a healthy baby boy. Breast imaging at the time of her last treatment revealed that the breast cancer doubled in size. She underwent repeat staging scans at the time revealing no evidence of metastatic disease. We therefore agreed to perform a left segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in an expedited fashion in order to allow her to proceed with further treatment in the form of Gemzar and carboplatinum. She completed 4 cycles with her last treatment being on January 3. She now presents to my office for further surgical management due to the finding of a deleterious BRCA-1 mutation detected during workup at the time of her neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. During time of her original surgery, Patient126 was not psychologically prepared to commit to a bilateral mastectomy for prophylaxis on the right side. She has also since seen Dr. Person36 in consultation for radiation treatment. It has been deemed necessary for her to receive postmastectomy radiation. In addition, she has seen Dr. de la Person20 for reconstructive options. We have decided that it would be best for her to wait until after receiving postmastectomy radiation before considering reconstructive surgery. She agrees to this.\\n\\nShe is now here in my office to schedule a bilateral total mastectomy. At the time of her original diagnosis, Patient126 was pregnant and therefore this post as a contraindication to bilateral breast MRI screening for her\\nBRCA mutation. Since she\\n Currently is nonpregnant, I would like to proceed with a bilateral breast MRI prior to her total mastectomy for the purposes of screening.\\n\\nThe patient\\'s last mammogram was negative.\\n\\n Family history is significant for a mother with colon cancer, father with T cell lymphoma, paternal grandmother with lung cancer and paternal grandfather with prostate cancer. She is not of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.\\n\\nShe denies any new onset weight loss, headaches, bone pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain.\\n\\nROS\\nThe Review of Systems was reviewed in the patient\\'s informational encounter dated 3/6/2014 and electronic chart, and otherwise the Review of Systems is negative.\\nAllergies\\nAllergies\\n Allergen Reactions\\n  Seasonal (Environmental Allergens)\\n\\n\\n\\nMedications\\nOutpatient Prescriptions Marked as Taking for the 3/6/14 encounter (Office Visit) with Person74, MD\\n Medication Sig Dispense Refill\\n  DOCUSATE SODIUM (COLACE ORAL) three tablets by mouth daily\\n\\n\\n  hydrocortisone (ANUSOL-HC) 2.5 % rect rectal cream Insert rectally 2 times a day\\n1 tube\\n0\\n  loratadine (CLARITIN) 10 mg Oral tablet PRN\\n\\n\\n  montelukast (SINGULAIR) 10 mg oral tablet TAKE 1 TABLET BY MOUTH IN THE EVENING\\n30 tablet\\n2\\n  MULTIVIT WITH CALCIUM,IRON,MIN (WOMEN\\'s MULTIPLE VITAMINS ORAL) Take by mouth One capsule by mouth daily\\n\\n\\n  prochlorperazine maleate (COMPAZINE) 10 mg oral tablet One tablet every 6-8 hours as needed\\n30 tablet\\n5\\n  Sertraline (ZOLOFT) 50 mg Oral tablet 1 daily\\n\\n\\n  tretinoin (RETIN-A) 0.025 % top topical cream Apply topically nightly Apply to face.\\n45 g\\n3\\n\\n No Facility-Administered Medications for the 3/6/14 encounter (Office Visit) with Person74, MD.\\n\\n\\n The patients Past Medical, Surgical, Social and Family Histories were reviewed.\\n\\n\\nPast Medical History\\nPast Medical History\\n Diagnosis Date\\n Depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified 2011\\nAbnormal glandular papanicolaou smear of cervix 2005\\n\\ncryo done, normal PAPs since then.\\n Malignant neoplasm of breast (female), unspecified site (hcc)\\n\\nSeasonal allergies\\n\\nAnxiety state, unspecified\\n\\nMigraine, unspecified, without mention of intractable migraine without mention of status migrainosus 2003\\n Low tsh 1/2/2013\\n Gestational diabetes mellitus 3/19/2013\\n\\n\\n Surgical History\\nPast Surgical History\\n Procedure Date\\n Dental procedure age 16\\n\\n\\n Family History\\nFamily History\\n Problem Comment Relation\\n Ca, Colon\\nMother\\n Ca, Lung\\nPaternal Grandmother\\n Ca, Prostate\\nPaternal Grandfather\\n Ca, Breast\\nNo History of\\n Ca, Ovarian\\nNo History of\\n Ca, Pancreatic\\nNo History of\\n Skin Conditions\\nNo History of\\n Ca, Skin Non-melanoma\\nNo History of\\n Ca, Leukemia T cell lymphoma Father\\n\\n\\n Social History\\nHistory\\n Substance Use Topics\\n  Smoking status: Former Smoker -- 0.25 packs/day for 10 years\\n\\n Types: Cigarettes\\n\\n Quit date: 12/14/2002\\n  Smokeless tobacco: Never Used\\n\\n\\nComment: 10 cigarettes/wk x 1 yr in college\\n  Alcohol Use: Yes\\n\\n\\n Breast Health and Related Information\\nBra Size: 46 DDD\\nDo you perform self breast exams?: Yes\\nMenarche - Age: 11\\nHRT Past Use: No\\nHRT Current Use: No\\nPast Use of Birth Control: Yes\\nPresent Use of Birth Control: No\\nBirth Control Duration: 13 yrs\\n\\n\\nPhysical exam\\nVitals: Blood pressure 142/84, height 5\\' 5.5\" (1.664 m), weight 332 lb (150.594 kg).Body mass index is 54.39 kg/(m^2).\\nGeneral Appearance:  Well appearing, nourished, comfortable.\\nHead and Neck:  No cervical lymphadenopathy.

On 7/10/13, she underwent left segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. A 6 cm incision was done at the 10' o-clock position. There no immediate postoperative complications. On 8/19, she developed erythema and tenderness over the entire left breast. She was seen in the ED and was started on cephalexin 500 mg po qid for cellulitis. She followed up with Dr. Person20 on 8/20. A seroma was noted. 80 cc of serous, non-purulent fluid was aspirated without difficulty. Cultures grew Citrobacter koseri. On 8/22, treatment was changed to ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid (based on antimicrobial susceptibilities). The erythema regressed after aspiration of the infected fluid. However, the patient has not improved further with oral antibiotic treatment. She denies fevers, chills or malaise. No nausea or vomiting. No chest pain other than breast tenderness.

The patient later developed cellulitis and an infected seroma underneath the incision site. Culture grew Citrobacter koseri. The patient improved partially after aspiration of the seroma with oral antibiotic treatment. A small fluid collection was aspirated this morning and cultures were sent. The rest of the lesion represents a phlegmon.\\n\\nCefepime is more stable to the action of ampC beta lactamases which can be encountered in infections due to Citrobacter.\\n\\nRecommend:  - Continue cefepime 2g iv q12h\\n- The patient improved partially on oral antibiotic treatment; thus will likely continue with iv antibiotics as outpatient.\\n -

On 8/19, she developed erythema and tenderness over the entire left breast. She was seen in the ED and was started on cephalexin 500 mg po qid for cellulitis. She followed up with Dr. Person6 on 8/20. A seroma was noted. 80 cc of serous, non-purulent fluid was aspirated without difficulty. Cultures grew Citrobacter koseri. On 8/22, treatment was changed to ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid (based on antimicrobial susceptibilities). The erythema regressed after aspiration of the infected fluid. However, the patient did not improve further with oral antibiotic treatment. She was admitted at MWH on 8/27 and was started on cefepime 2g iv q12h. On 8/28 she had aspiration of another small collection (3cc). Culture again grew Citrobacter. She improved clinically and was discharged on 8/29. She was treated for 2 weeks until 9/10.

Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient.\\nAs you well know, Patient126 is a very pleasant 32-year-old Caucasian female who presents with her husband and newborn child today secondary to a recent diagnosis of left breast cancer in addition to BRCA1 gene positivity seeking consultation for possible breast reconstruction.\\nHer history of present illness includes a diagnosis of left breast cancer during her pregnancy with her first child.\\nShe subsequently underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and recently had the birth of a healthy baby.\\nHer diagnosis includes initially a large left axillary lymph node with subsequent biopsy being negative for metastatic cancer.\\nHowever, due to her BRCA gene positivity, she is strongly considering bilateral mastectomy and again presents today for consultation for options on reconstruction.\\n\\nPast Medical History:  Significant for morbid obesity, the above-stated breast cancer, gestational diabetes, postpartum depression, seasonal allergies and migraines.\\n\\nPrevious Surgical History:  Includes only previous dental procedure, C-section associated with birth of her child on May 10, 2013.\\n\\nCurrent Medication List:  Includes prenatal vitamins, Zoloft, Colace, Flonase, Singulair, and Claritin.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  SHE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\\nDOES HAVE SENSITIVITY TO ADHESIVE TAPE.\\n\\nSocial History:  She is married and presents with her husband, Person17, and a young child.\\nShe has a distant history of smoking, having quit in 2001.\\nShe drinks social alcohol.\\nShe is employed as a claims manager.\\nShe is right-hand dominant.\\n\\nFamily History:  Significant for a mother who passed away in 1992 secondary to colon cancer.\\nHer father passed in 2010 secondary to T-cell\\nlymphoma.\\nShe has siblings who are in good health.\\n\\nReview of Systems:  Positive for the above-stated breast cancer, gestational diabetes and the postpartum depression.\\nAll other systems reviewed and found to be negative.\\n\\nPhysical Examination:  General:  She is a well-nourished, well-developed adult female, appears her stated age.\\nShe is morbidly obese in nature, standing 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighing 306 pounds.\\nHer bra size is stated to be a 46 DDD.\\nOn examination of her breasts, she has very large pendulous breasts with grade III mammary ptosis and essential macromastia.\\nMeasurements include a sternal notch to nipple distance on the right of 38.5 cm, the left of 38 cm and breast diameter of 16 cm.\\nThe nipples were everted, but downward facing.\\nWe did not examine her abdominal wall.\\n\\nOverall, Patient126 is a very pleasant 32-year-old Caucasian female with a pregnancy associated left breast cancer and recent diagnosis of BRCA gene 1 positivity who seeks consultation for reconstructive options.\\nWe therefore discussed with the patient the broad-spectrum of options in her case including undergoing breast conservation therapy and associated lumpectomy with no reconstruction, undergoing oncoplastic surgery in order to resect her left breast tumor within the context of a bilateral reduction mammoplasty and finally options for unilateral versus bilateral whole breast reconstruction associated with mastectomy.\\nShe is of course due to her gene diagnosis is leaning towards bilateral mastectomy and we therefore discussed with her in additional detail options including immediate versus delayed timing of reconstruction and implant-based versus tissue-based versus mixed types of reconstruction.\\nIn her particular case due to her morbid obesity, this puts her at greater risk for donor site complications associated with tissue-based surgery and we therefore\\nstrongly discouraged her from going ____ immediate reconstruction at her current weight utilizing her abdomen as a donor site.\\nWe discussed options of 2-stage implant reconstruction.\\nHowever, again given her weight, the cosmesis of even a maximal size implant is questionable.\\nWe therefore also discussed with her options including delayed reconstruction in order to achieve some element of weight loss and therefore, improved outcome in both implant-based reconstruction and tissue-based reconstruction.\\nShe is currently completing her neoadjuvant chemotherapy to be completed either on June 26, 2013, or possibly continue further.\\nWe therefore have provided for her additional resource materials including the Emmi program, the DVD for reconstruction, additional written materials and I have encouraged her to contact us to correspond with us by phone, E-mail or in person in regards to answering additional questions before deciding on proceeding with breast reconstruction.\\nOnce again, thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient.\\nOf note, we spent approximately 45 minutes with the patient and her family today with greater than 50% in counseling.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson10, MD\\nDivision of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\\n\\nD:  06/07/2013 08:50AM, VTN T:  06/07/2013 01:39PM,

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient126 is a 32 year old female with a new diagnosis of a left breast invasive ductal carcinoma that is triple negative. The patient self palpated a mass and presented to her obstetrician since she is pregnant. The obstetrician then sent her for an ultrasound which showed a hypoechoic mass. She then underwent a mammogram which showed an approximately 3.5 cm mass in the upper inner quadrant of the left breast. This was subsequently biopsied, and proven to be an invasive ductal carcinoma that was triple negative. The patient is here to continue neoadjuvant treatment. She is here prior to cycle #2 of Adriamycin and Cytoxan.\\nThe plan for Ms. Patient126 is to proceed with cycle #2.\\n\\nThe patient will return to the clinic in 3 weeks for cycle #3.\\n\\nThe patient was instructed to hold her morning dose of Zofran tomorrow and assess for any possible nausea. If nausea occurs later that morning and early afternoon, she may take her dose of Zofran.\\n\\nSide effects and management of chemotherapy were discussed with the patient.\\n\\n\\nDictated by Person10, CRNP.\\nPatient126 is in agreement to proceed with this plan as stated.\\nTime spent face to face with the patient was 25 minutes, total counseling time was 20 minutes.\\nDuring that time, all of the patients questions were answered in detail.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['3@e@patient126_report023_NOTE@gold', '4@e@patient126_report023_NOTE@gold', '5@e@patient126_report023_NOTE@gold', '6@e@patient126_report023_NOTE@gold', '7@e@patient126_report023_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['Adriamycin', 'Cytoxan', 'Adriamycin', 'Cytoxan', 'chemotherapy'], 'span': [[759, 769], [774, 781], [8049, 8059], [8064, 8071], [8424, 8436]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient126_report023_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['today'], 'span': [[720, 725]], 'id': [0]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient126_report023_NOTE@gold', 'ment': '20130104', 'span': [228, 236]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report105_NOTE': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................76,d3kHPNQ6euy6\\nPatient ID....................d3kHPNQ6euy6\\nPatient Name..................Patient126\\nPrincipal Date................20130927\\nRecord Type...................NOTE\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\nPROGRESS NOTE\\nSUBJECTIVE: Patient126 is a 33 year old\\nfemale\\nwith stage T1c N0 M0 left breast invasive ductal carcinoma in November 2012, while pregnant.

Patient126 was diagnosed with a triple negative left breast invasive ductal carcinoma in late 2012 after palpating a mass. She was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 12 cycles of Taxol. The lesion progressed through treatment and therefore she underwent left segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy on June 8, 2013. Her surgical margins were negative and she was treated with adjuvant Gemzar and carboplatin x 4 cycles. She was found to have BRCA1 mutation and elected to undergo bilateral total mastectomies on March 19, 2014. Pathology was negative for metastatic/residual disease. She subsequently completed left chest wall radiation (50.4 Gy) on June 18, 2014.\\nShe presented to the emergency room in October with acute back pain and shortness of breath. A chest CT was performed and was negative for pulmonary embolism, however a left lower lobe superior segment nodule was identified. Although not reported on the PET scan from July 2013, it is reported to have been present in retrospect. A PET scan was performed and the lesion is mildly PET avid with an SUV of 2.6. She is referred to thoracic surgery for resection of the suspected metastatic nodule.\\n\\n Patient126 denies any recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath. She reports no cough or hemoptysis. In general she feels quite well other than anxiety relating to the nodule and her history of breast cancer. She smoked socially in college but not significantly.\\n$&\\nReview of Systems:  General Health:  Recent weight change:No\\nFever:No\\nFatigue: No Muscles and Bones:  Arthritis/joint pain/weakness: No\\nCrampy pain in calves: No\\nSurgery on blood vessels: No\\n Eyes and Vision:  Eye disease or injury: No\\nBlurred or double vision: No Neurologic:  Frequent or recurrent headaches: No\\nParalysis: No\\n Ears, Nose, Throat:  Sinus problems: No\\n Bad breath or bad taste: No\\nVoice Changes: No Psychiatric:  Memory Loss or confusion: No\\nNervousness/anxiety: Yes\\n\\n Heart and Cardiovascular:  Chest pain: No\\nChest pressure: No\\nChest heaviness: No\\nSudden heartbeat changes: No\\nLeg Swelling: No Endocrine:  Thyroid problems: No\\nHeat or cold intolerance: No\\nHair loss: No\\n\\n Respiratory:  Frequent coughing: No\\nCoughing up blood: No\\nShortness of breath: No\\nUse inhalers: No\\nUse of BiPAP or CPAP: No Hematologic/Lymphatic:  Anemia or low blood count: No\\n Easy bruising: No\\nSwollen lymph glands: No\\n Gastrointestinal:  Heartburn: No\\nFood Sticking: No\\nGassy/bloating: No\\nThrowing up blood: No\\nUlcer in stomach: No\\nExcessive flatulence (passing gas): No\\nDiarrhea: No\\nConstipation: No\\nBlood in stool: No\\nPain in stomach: No Kidney Problems:  Kidney Failure: No\\nNeed Dialysis: No\\n\\nIntegumentary\\nSkin Cancer/Skin Condition: No\\nSkin Lesion/Rash: No\\n Genitourinary:  Frequent urination/burning/blood: No\\nBurning with urination: No\\nBleeding with urination: No\\nKidney stones: No\\n\\n$!\\n\\nMedications:  Current Outpatient Prescriptions:  acetaminophen-codeine (TYLENOL-CODEINE #3) 300-30 mg oral tablet\\n\\nclindamycin (CLINDAGEL) 1 % top gel Apply to acne once daily in morning.\\n DOCUSATE SODIUM (COLACE ORAL) three tablets by mouth daily\\n doxycycline hyclate (VIBRAMYCIN) 100 mg oral capsule One po bid x 2 weeks then one po qd x 2 weeks.

I personally reviewed Patient126\\'s chest CT and PET scan. The left lower lobe lung lesion is concerning for metastatic disease from her recently treated breast carcinoma. Differential diagnosis would also include benign infectious or inflammatory disease or less likely primary lung carcinoma. I recommend a left thoracoscopic wedge resection versus superior segmentectomy for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. I described the technical aspects of the procedure as well as the risks which include but are not limited to bleeding, infection, prolonged air leak, cardiopulmonary events such as respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction and/or death. Patient126\\'s questions were answered satisfactorily and she has agreed to proceed on Monday December . Person17. Pulmonary function tests will be obtained prior to surgery.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient126_report159_NOTE@gold', '3@e@patient126_report159_NOTE@gold',

Ms.\\nPatient156 initially was found to have an abnormality on screening mammogram in\\nOctober 2009.  It showed a 1.1 cm lesion in the upper outer quadrant of her\\nleft breast.  Ultrasound confirmed an irregularly shaped lesion at the 12\\no'clock position measuring 0.7 cm.  On October 23 biopsy showed invasive ductal\\ncarcinoma which was nuclear grade 3.  The tumor was ER negative with an H score\\nof 0, PR negative with an H score of 0, and HER-2 equivocal scoring 2+ by\\nimmunohistochemistry.  FISH was negative for amplification of the HER-2/neu\\ngene with a ratio of HER-2/neu signals to chromosome 17 centromere signals of\\n1.52.  The Ki-67 was 30%.  On October 28 bilateral breast MRI showed the\\nsolitary 7 mm biopsy-proven cancer at the 12 o'clock position of the left\\nbreast.  The right breast appeared normal.  No enlarged lymph nodes were\\nidentified.  On November 12 you performed a left breast segmental mastectomy\\nand sentinel node biopsy.  Final pathology showed invasive ductal carcinoma,\\nwhich was Nottingham grade 3, with a score of 8 of 9.  The invasive tumor\\nmeasured 0.55 cm in largest dimension.  Margins were negative.  There was\\nprominent periductal lymphocytic infiltrate.  Three sentinel lymph nodes were\\nnegative for involvement.  Further immunohistochemical stain showed the\\ninvasive tumor cells were patchy positive for EGFR and CK 5 and negative for CK\\n14 and 17 and suggestive of the basal-like phenotype.\\n\\nCurrently Ms. Patient156 is recovering well after her surgery.  Her 14 point review\\nof systems is negative as documented in the paper chart by Person136.\\nPast medical history includes hypertension and diverticulosis.  Past surgical\\nhistory includes a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo\\noophorectomy in 1998, as well as an appendectomy.

There is no\\nhistory of breast or ovarian cancer in the family.\\n\\nShe is gravida 2, para 2.  She was 18 years old with her first pregnancy.  She\\nstarted menstruating at age 13.  She used birth control pills for 2 years.  She\\nwent through menopause at age 48 when she had her hysterectomy and\\noophorectomy.  She did use hormone replacement therapy for 1 year.\\n\\nOn physical examination in general she is a healthy-appearing woman who looks\\nyounger than her stated age.  She is accompanied by her daughter.  Vital signs\\nare stable and normal as documented in the paper chart.  Skin is normal without\\nrashes or jaundice.  HEENT exam shows pupils equally round and reactive.  She\\nhas anicteric sclerae.  She has moist mucous membranes.  Neck is supple without\\nmasses or thyromegaly.

The tumor measured 0.55 cm in greatest dimension.  Three sentinel\\nnodes were negative for involvement.  There was no lymphovascular space\\ninvasion.  We had a discussion\\ntoday regarding the possibility of adjuvant medical therapy for her breast\\ncancer.  She is aware that she will need radiation to complete her local\\ncontrol for her breast cancer.  With regard to adjuvant therapy I explained to\\nher she is not a candidate for anti-estrogen therapy due to her tumor's ER\\nnegativity.  I next explained to her that her tumor size of 0.55 cm is right on\\nthe cut-off of where I currently recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for\\nER-negative tumors.  In her case I did recommend to her that she undergo\\ntreatment with the TC regimen for 4 cycles being that she is so young and\\nhealthy and we cannot use endocrine therapy to decrease her risk.  I explained\\nto her that there is a significant possibility that we will be over-treating\\nher, but that the goal of chemotherapy is to eradicate microscopic deposits of\\ndisease, and we have no way of knowing whether she does have microscopic\\ndisease at this time.  She is agreeable to erring on the side of overtreatment\\nand in order to be aggressive with her breast cancer care.  She desires to\\npursue chemotherapy.  We will start the TC regimen in early January.  She was\\ngiven prescriptions for premedications for nausea on steroids to prevent\\nallergic reaction to the Taxane.  She was counseled on potential side effects\\nof chemotherapy including but not limited to organ failure, infection,\\ninfertility, secondary leukemia, neutropenic fever, neuropathy and allergic\\nreactions.  We will talk about side effects of chemotherapy next visit when she\\ncomes to start.\\n\\nThank you for referring her.  We will continue to follow her in the future.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerson10, MD\\n\\n\\n\\nThis document is electronically signed by:   Person86  Person8 MD on 12/22/2009\\nat 11:02:57 AM

that was ER\\nnegative, PR negative, and HER-2 negative.\\n\\nPREVIOUS THERAPY:\\nShe underwent left segmental mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy on November\\n12, 2009.  Pathology showed a 0.55 cm tumor with 0 out of 3 positive lymph\\nnodes.\\nShe underwent adjuvant chemotherapy with Taxotere and Cytoxan x4 cycles started\\nin January 2010 until March 2010.\\nShe underwent left breast radiation completed in May 2010.\\n\\nINTERIM HISTORY:  Ms. Patient156 is doing well.  She had a brief episode of\\ndesaturation last visit and some symptomatic shortness of breath which prompted\\na pulmonary referral.  She saw Dr. Person31, who feels she may have\\nasthma, and she has pulmonary function tests pending.  She was negative for PE\\non that evaluation.  Otherwise, on review of systems, she feels well.  She has\\nno acute complaints as documented in the paper chart.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  Fully documented in the paper chart.  Notable findings include\\nthat she is status post left breast segmental mastectomy with some radiation\\nchanges.  She has no masses palpated in either breast.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY:  Includes a CT angiogram of the chest done on June 7th.  It was\\nnegative for a pulmonary embolism.  Note was made of pulmonary micro-nodules\\nthat were also seen on her radiation planning CT in March.  A 6-month followup\\nwas recommended.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 59-year-old postmenopausal woman with left breast, T1\\nN0, invasive ductal carcinoma which is triple negative.  She is status post\\nadjuvant chemotherapy with Taxotere and Cytoxan x4 cycles.  She has no evidence\\nof recurrent disease at this point.  We will continue to see her for\\nsurveillance every 4 months.  Her mammogram is due in October 2010.  She was\\ngiven a script for that today.  Next visit, we will order the followup chest CT\\nfor her pulmonary micro-nodules, which were likely benign in etiology, and she\\nwill continue to follow with Dr. Person21 for her asthma.\\n\\n\\n_________________________\\n\\nPerson10, MD\\n\\n\\n\\nThis document is electronically signed by:   Person86  Person8 MD on 07/12/2010\\nat 4:29:02 PM (CST) Verification: \\n\\n\\nD: 07/06/2010 01:09 PM (EST)          T: 07/06/2010 02:02 PM (EST)\\nDJN: \\nSJN: \\n738217\\n\\n\\ncc:\\nPerson17, MD\\nInternal Medicine - Institution\\n, \\nLocation, PA \\n\\nPerson22, MD\\n, \\nLocation, PA \\n\\nPerson31, MD\\nInstitution Medical Building\\n., \\nLocation, PA \\n\\nPerson77, MD\\nInstitution\\n\\nLocation PA \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient156_report065_PGN@gold', '3@e@patient156_report065_PGN@gold', '6@e@patient156_report065_PGN@gold', '7@e@patient156_report065_PGN@gold'], 'ment': ['Taxotere', 'Cytoxan', 'Taxotere', 'Cytoxan'], 'span': [[820, 828], [833, 840], [2032, 2040], [2045, 2052]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['4@e@patient156_report065_PGN@gold', '5@e@patient156_report065_PGN@gold'], 'ment': ['January 2010', 'March 2010'], 'span': [[862, 874], [881, 891]], 'id': [0, 1]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient156_report065_PGN@gold', 'ment': '20100706', 'span': [230, 238]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report044_ER': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................1496,GR4OPUMTyNrV\\nPatient ID....................GR4OPUMTyNrV\\nPatient Name..................Patient156\\nPrincipal Date................20100312 1358\\nRecord Type...................ER\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\n\\n\\nInstitution OF Institution\\nEMERGENCY DEPARTMENT\\n\\nPATIENT NAME:  Patient156\\nACCOUNT #:  \\nDATE OF SERVICE:  03/12/10\\nPRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:\\n\\n\\nDate of service is 03/12/2010.\\n\\nI saw and examined the patient myself.

tolerating everything reasonably well.\\nHer breast is getting less red, less swollen, and is getting softer.\\nHer pain in her back is improving, but she still requires Ultram.\\nShe said immediately after the radiation, her back does hurt, but over the ensuing days, it is better.\\nThe Ultram seems to be controlling her pain.\\nShe had an extra visit on October 30th for what looked like cellulitis of her leg.\\nI gave her a course of Cipro, fortunately that not only caused her skin lesions to regress and her cellulitis to improve, but she actually was not allergic to it, which is unusual for this lady who has multiple drug allergies.\\n\\n She presents today.\\nShe still has an occasional nosebleed.\\nWhen she blows her nose, some time stringy blood comes out.\\nEverything has been self-limited, though she has not had to go to the ER or pack or nose.\\nShe has not had vaginal bleeding.\\nShe has not had rectal bleeding.\\nShe always has chest pain because of her underlying cardiac disease, but that\\nhas been no different.\\nShe is a little more short of breath and a little more tired.\\nOtherwise, she seems to be tolerating things reasonably well.\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, aspirin, omega-3 fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B, Lutein, Tylenol, Avastin injections to her eyes per Dr. Person6.\\nDecadron premeds for her chemo.\\nUltram for pain.\\nCompazine for nausea.\\nPrilosec for reflux.\\nShe completed a course of Cipro for cellulitis.\\nNystatin and MBX help with her mucositis.\\n\\n FAMILY HISTORY:  See the old chart.\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY:  See the old chart.\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No visual problems.\\nShe has occasional self-limited nosebleed.\\nHer mouth pain is better with MBX.\\nShe does not have a cough.\\nShe has the usual amount of shortness of breath.\\nShe has not had increased chest pain.\\nHer breast is less red and more soft.\\nNo abdominal pain.\\nThe reddening of her legs that we treated as a cellulitis, improved.\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows an anxious elderly lady.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, pulse 88, respirations 16, blood pressure 153/73, 164 pounds, 94% on room air.\\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nExtraocular movements intact.\\nShe is starting to develop alopecia.\\nOropharynx, no obvious intraoral lesion.\\nNECK:  No nodes.\\nLUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds at the base.\\nBACK:  No spinal tenderness.\\nHEART:  Regular, occasional premature beat.\\nBREASTS:  Her breast is less red, it is soft, the mass feels less firm.\\nThe nipple is not as inverted.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft.\\nEXTREMITIES:  The red lesions on her legs are improved.\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 138, potassium 4.2, chloride 104, bicarbonate 29, BUN 22, creatinine 1.53.\\nWhite count 8.7, hematocrit 26.9, platelets of 222.\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nElderly lady with a significant cardiac history who has an inflammatory left-sided breast cancer that is ER positive, PR negative,\\nHER-2/neu amplified by FISH.\\nShe has solitary metastatic lesion to the spine which is symptomatic.\\nDr. Person50 is giving her very limited field radiation.\\nI am going to go ahead and treat her with\\nchemotherapy.\\nGiven the gravity of this situation, I am going to go ahead and go ahead with her second cycle of chemotherapy.\\nGiven how much her platelets drop with her first cycle, I am going to modestly dose reduce her.\\nShe will go ahead and get her second cycle of chemotherapy.\\nDr. Person50 will complete his limited field radiation.\\n2.\\nMouth sores, better with nystatin.\\n3.\\nCardiac issues.\\nShe follows with Dr. Person17.\\n4.\\nAnemia.\\nHer hematocrit is no worse.\\n5.\\nPain.\\nI renewed her Ultram.\\n6.\\nCellulitis.\\nBetter after Cipro.\\n7.\\nRenal insufficiency.\\nI note her creatinine is up.\\nShe is on a host of medications that can affect her renal function.\\nWe will keep an eye on that.\\nWe will defer to Dr. Person20 and Dr. Person17 as to adjusting other medications such as her Lasix.\\n\\n So in summary, we will treat her today, Neulasta tomorrow.\\nDr. Person50 will

scar.\\nThere is no obvious dermal mets, no skin breakdown.\\nOpposite breast is pendulous without masses.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft and protuberant.\\nPositive bowel sounds.\\nRECTAL:  Deferred.\\nGENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\nEXTREMITIES:  Trace edema.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Motor is intact.\\nSensory is intact.\\nNo focal deficits.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 105, bicarbonate 28, BUN 21, creatinine 1.26, white count 3, hematocrit 32.7, and platelets are 99.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a now 78-year-old woman with a significant cardiac history who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nThus she was considered to have stage IV breast cancer at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion in her spine.\\nShe had four cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nIdeally six were planned; however, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after four cycles, it was felt she had obtained maximum benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress.\\nShe had surgery.\\nEven after this course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she\\nbarely tolerated, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nSo this per se was stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she did have the bone metastasis, so her actual stage is stage IV breast cancer.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nHer scans still showed uptake in the thoracic spine.\\nI reviewed all those scans with her.\\nI thought it would be difficult to administer chest wall radiation because of the pacer on that side.\\nSo even if we were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put it on the right side, one would still have concerns about compromising her already challenged cardio-respiratory status because she has a left ventricular aneurysm.\\nSo, we elected not to do radiation.\\nIn the meantime, her counts were marginal and her ejection fraction was low.\\nWe did not plan any further chemotherapy.\\nWe actually did not plan any further Herceptin.\\nWe put her on Aromasin.\\nShe tolerated that reasonably well.\\nWe repeated her ejection fraction and her MUGA scan improved.\\nHer ejection fraction looked better.\\nSo, we tried to reinstitute Herceptin.\\nSo, her current plan is to continue the Aromasin for five years.\\nWe are going to attempt to deliver Herceptin every three weeks for a total of 11 planned doses.\\nThis is dose #3 of Herceptin alone.\\nI plan to do a MUGA scan in mid September.\\nWe will get MUGA scans every three months while she is on Herceptin.\\nIf her ejection fraction drops, we will discontinue the Herceptin and go with Aromasin alone.\\nI think we need to keep a very close watch\\non her left chest wall.\\nShe does have some red lesions and telangiectasias.\\nI am hoping those are not early dermal mets.\\nIf they start changing, we may have to readdress the issue of radiation.\\nIf it is looking like she is getting dermal mets, perhaps radiation can be considered for some sort of very superficial radiation alone that would not affect her port.\\nAt any rate for now, we will do very close watchful waiting.\\n2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nShe is going to get Zometa every six weeks.\\n3.\\nCardiac issues again.\\nHer MUGA scan is in mid September.\\n4.\\nAnemia with abnormal iron stores.\\nHer hematocrit is stable.\\nWe will recheck those iron stores in the future.\\n5.\\nPersistently low white count looks stable.\\n6.\\nThrombocytopenia looks stable.\\n7.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nHer port is working.\\n\\nSo in summary, MUGA and mammogram in mid September, proceed with Herceptin.\\nI will see her in three weeks with labs.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson29, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person29, MD on 08/17/2013 at 09:35

normal left femur, questionable osteoblastic mets, left ischial tuberosity.\\nHip, ill-defined area of increased bone density suggesting osteoblastic mets.\\nMUGA scan, ejection\\nfraction of 44%; no change compared to September.\\nBone scan, interval increase in size and intensity of the focus of uptake in left hip, no change in left fourth DJD.\\nCT chest, abdomen and pelvis, no evidence of metastatic disease, cardiomegaly, old parenchymal scarring.\\nMarked impression, T4 cholelithiasis, no acute disease.\\nLast CA15-3 was 26.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a 78-year-old woman with a significant cardiac history who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine at presentation; therefore, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion to her spine.\\nShe had 4 cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nThis was completed by January 2013.\\nIdeally 6 cycles were planned, but she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after those 4 cycles, it was felt she probably obtained her maximum benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress somewhat.\\nShe had a mastectomy in February 2013.\\nSo, even after a course of Herceptin and chemotherapy, which she could barely tolerate, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThe breast itself was stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she had a solitary bone metastasis at presentation.\\nSo she has stage IV metastatic breast cancer from the very beginning.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nUpon completion of her mastectomy, we talked about other options.\\nAt that point, it was felt that it would be difficult to administer chest wall radiation.\\nThe patient had a pacemaker and defibrillator on that left side.\\nEven if it were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put it on the other side, there were still concerns about radiation therapy to her left side in light of her already compromised and\\nchallenged cardiorespiratory status.\\nShe had stage IV disease to begin with anyway.\\nSo, with these concerns, it was elected not to do chest wall radiation at that time.\\nIn the meantime, her counts remain marginal.\\nShe was put on Arimidex because she was ER positive.\\nHer ejection fraction which was marginal had declined.\\nSo further Herceptin was held.\\nShe tolerated the Arimidex exceedingly poorly.\\nWe then moved on to Aromasin.\\nThe whole time she was on Aromasin, she complained of hot flashes, emotional lability, and headaches.\\nHer ejection fraction improved a bit.\\nWe added Herceptin back.\\nShe had 3 doses of Herceptin.\\nSo for a brief period of time, about 9 weeks, she was on Herceptin and Aromasin.\\nShe did not tolerate that very well at all.\\nWe then did another MUGA scan, that was done on September 13.\\nHer ejection fraction dropped to the mid 40.\\nTherefore, for that reason alone, we held the Herceptin.\\nShe continued to complain of headaches while on Aromasin.\\nA CAT scan of her head in August showed no brain mets.\\nIn the midst of all these complaints about her intolerance of Aromasin and having her Herceptin put on hold, it was noticed that some lesions on her chest wall were getting worse.\\nShe was not clearly manifesting dermal metastasis.\\nBecause she now had overt progression with dermal metastasis, we had to address the chest wall.\\nUltimately, she went back to her cardiologist.\\nHe was able to remove the pacemaker and defibrillator.\\nContrary to the patient\\'s concern that she would have to go through another procedure and have a pacemaker placed on the opposite side, she did not have to do that.\\nShe actually just had to have the pacemaker removed.\\nShe is now without a pacemaker.\\nShe completed her radiation therapy.\\nShe did have some moist desquamation of her chest wall.\\nShe had to go through Institution.\\nWhile we are\\nawaiting for her to recover, we talked about other options.\\nOne option might be to go back to an anti-HER-2 agent, perhaps Kadcyla would be appropriate if we thought these chest wall lesions occurred right after getting Herceptin.\\nSo we got a MUGA scan.\\nThe MUGA scan is still poor, it is no worse than it had been, but it is no better and she is quite symptomatic in terms of shortness of breath.\\nWe took a hormonal approach.\\nShe was not doing well on Aromasin and the chest wall lesions got worse on Aromasin anyway.\\nTherefore, we started her on Faslodex.\\nShe is tolerating the Faslodex surprisingly well, so we will continue the Faslodex and we will also continue the Zometa for bone mets.\\nCompared to her last bone scan and x-rays, the lesion in her hip looks a little more prominent on the bone scan.\\nThe plain films really are as dictated above.\\nShe can perhaps\\nhave an MRI now since she does not have a pacemaker in.\\nShe is not symptomatic in terms of hip pain, but I am going to order the MRI or have her see Radiation Oncology to see if they want to administer palliative radiation or if she is indeed asymptomatic, maybe she does not need palliated with radiation at this point.\\nShe has no evidence of visceral disease.\\nShe is elderly.\\nShe has a poor ejection fraction.\\nWe will see if a hormonal approach to this problem will work as opposed to going to an anti-HER-2/neu agent at this point.\\n 2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nAs above, she is having an MRI.\\nWe will continue her Zometa.\\nWe might want to think about changing her to Xgeva.\\n 3.\\nAnemia, hematocrit and iron stores are about the same.\\n 4.\\nThrombocytopenia, about the same.\\n 5.\\nPersistently low white count.\\nStable.\\n 6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nPort flushed every month.\\n ADDENUM NO MRI TO BE DONE BECAUSE \"leads\" from previous pacer still there\\n\\n\\n Greater than 45 minutes were spent with the patient, her husband and\\ndaughter-in-law.\\nAll the scans were reviewed with the patient.\\nThe patient was given copies of all her scans.\\nShe expressed good understanding.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson29, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person29, MD on 02/10/2014 at 04:49 PM\\n\\n\\nD:

cycles of Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin.\\nShe presented with an inflammatory left-sided breast cancer.\\nThis course of therapy has required several dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia, as well as anemia.\\nFurthermore, her most recent MUGA scan, which is done on a routine basis because she is on Herceptin, shows that her ejection fraction has decreased from 49.6% to 44.6%.\\nShe does admit to being more short of breath and more tired.\\nShe does have some sinus drainage.\\nShe has not coughed up any blood or any phlegm.\\nShe has not had nausea or vomiting.\\nIn terms of her compression fracture, she has not had any sustained back pain.\\nShe has not noticed any appreciable changes in her breasts since she was last here on January 28th.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, fish oil, vitamin D3, vitamin B12, Lutein, Tylenol, Avastin eye drops, ibuprofen, and Prilosec.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA, CARDURA, MORPHINE, DEMEROL, BACTRIM, POLY IRON, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, PORK, COFFEE, AND GINGER.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Her vision is the same.\\nShe still has some nasal drainage.\\nShe has not had any mouth sores.\\nShe does feel more short of\\nbreath.\\nShe does not have hemoptysis.\\nShe does not have pleuritic pain.\\nShe does not have substernal chest pain.\\nShe does not have

rashes.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Examination shows a fragile lady.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, pulse 76, respirations 16, and blood pressure 164/85.\\nWeight 153 pounds.\\nHEENT:  Temporal wasting.\\nPupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.\\nNares, no discharge.\\nOropharynx, no lesion.\\nNECK:  No nodes.\\nLUNGS:  Increased kyphotic curve.\\nHEART:  Regular, occasional premature beats.\\nBREASTS:  Her left breast still has a palpable mass that is mobile.\\nIt is not fixed to the skin.\\nThere is no skin breakdown.\\nThere is no palpable axillary adenopathy.\\nOpposite breast, without masses.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft.\\nRECTAL:  Deferred.\\nGENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\nEXTREMITIES:  No edema.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 141, potassium 4, chloride 104, and bicarbonate 28.\\nBUN 17, and creatinine is 0.98.\\nAdjusted calcium is 9.2, bilirubin is 0.5, ALT 17, AST 21, and alkaline phosphatase is 74.\\nWhite count 4.4, hematocrit 30.5, and platelets of 96.\\n\\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:  Her last MUGA scan shows a mildly reduced ejection fraction of 44.6%.\\nThis is decreased from the prior study of three months ago when it was 49.6%.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nLeft-sided inflammatory breast cancer; ER positive, PR negative, and HER-2/neu amplified by FISH.\\nThe patient has had four cycles of Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin.\\nShe has had multiple dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia.\\nAlso now on her MUGA scan, her ejection fraction drop would suggest that we need to hold her Herceptin and recheck her MUGA scan in four weeks.\\nThis lady initially, when we started her neoadjuvant\\ntherapy, appeared to be responding insofar as her breast mass improved, the nipple retraction went away, and the redness of the skin of the breast went away; however, I think her response has plateaued.\\nHer breast looks better, but really I do not think we had much more improvement between the third and the fourth cycle.\\nWe had to have dose delays because of thrombocytopenia and now evidently we have to hold her Herceptin because of the decrease in her ejection fraction.\\nPerhaps, we have reached the point of maximal response.\\nI discussed the case with Dr. Person6; he is going to see her in the next few days.\\nPerhaps, four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be all we will be able to deliver and that we have reached our maximum response.\\nIf that is the case, perhaps we ought to do her surgery if she is cleared from cardiology standpoint.\\nAfter her surgery, we would get another MUGA scan and if her ejection fraction starts to improve, then we would go back on the Herceptin; or if it does not improve, we can just treat her with hormone therapy.\\nAs this is inflammatory breast cancer, after her mastectomy, radiation to her chest wall would have to be entertained; however, given her cardiac disease and her pacemaker, I would defer to Dr. Person50 if that is even feasible, but for now, I will wait to hear what Dr. Person6 have to say in the upcoming days.\\n2.\\nBone metastases.\\nShe is status post limited-field radiation to T4.\\nI do believe she was due for Zometa today, but we inadvertently did not administer it, so we will do it next week.\\n3.\\nAnemia, hematocrit looks stable.\\n4.\\nCardiac issues, MUGA scan as above; did discuss this with Dr. Person17.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson34, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person34, MD on 02/06/2013 at 09:53 PM\\n\\n\\nD:  02/04/2013 12:01PM, DP\\nT:  02/05/2013 12:40AM,

Elderly lady with an extensive cardiac history who was admitted with\\nincreased shortness of breath, acute and chronic systolic and diastolic\\ncongestive heart failure. She was markedly anemic when she came in, she\\nwas transfused, she was diuresed, she looks more comfortable. She has\\npositive cardiac enzymes and is being monitored. She is a patient of Dr Person6.\\n\\nECHO above\\nH/h stable\\npt appears improved\\n2. Metastatic breast cancer. She was last evaluated by scans in October.\\nThe scans showed progressive disease in bone. The MUGA scan showed\\nimproved ejection fraction. After an extensive discussion, the patient\\nwished to go back on anti HER2/neu agents. Therefore, in the metastatic\\nsetting, we started Kadcyla. She had 1 dose of Kadcyla October 21st. We\\nwill defer on further systemic interventions of this nature until her\\ncardiac status is stabilized. Perhaps given her tenuous cardiac status,\\nshe may not tolerate these anti HER2 agents and may be a candidate for\\nhormonal blocking therapy alone. She has progressed through aromatase\\ninhibitors. She has progressed through Faslodex. Perhaps, a trial of\\ntamoxifen might be all this elderly lady might be able to tolerate.\\n\\nECHO above\\nhold on kadcyla till cardiac events resolved\\n3. Anemia symptomatically better after transfusion. She is on steroids\\nfor an element of hemolysis. She has received Venofer in the past. We\\nwill follow her CBC. She has received chemotherapy in the past. Perhaps\\nher bone marrow is compromised on that basis. Clearly, her marginal blood\\ncounts will also further dissuade us from any further aggressive\\nintervention in her breast cancer.\\n4. Thrombocytopenia, ongoing problem, we will monitor her platelet count.\\nNo real change Plts 82 today\\n5. Pain from bone mets. She appears well palliated. Dr. Person12 will resume\\nradiation when she is deemed medically ready. Perhaps, a Palliative Care\\nconsult to help better define the goals of care in this complicated patient\\nwould be warranted.\\n6.

HER-2/neu amplified with possible metastatic disease to thoracic spine.\\n\\n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient114 is a 77-year-old woman with a host of cardiac issues who presented with clinical inflammatory breast cancer.\\nShe is here to start her first cycle of Herceptin, Taxotere, and carboplatin.\\nThe rationale for this therapy was discussed with her at length during her last visit with me on October 9.\\nShe presents today.\\nShe is still having some back pain and pain in her ribs.\\nRecall that this was a lady whose PET scan showed not only activity in her left breast, but at T4 as well.\\nHer CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed left breast cancer with prominent left axillary lymph nodes.\\nA bone scan showed metastatic disease to T4.\\nThis lady cannot have an MRI of her thoracic spine because she has a pacer in.\\nThe Radiology Department suggested perhaps that we do a CAT scan of her thoracic spine.\\nThis lady is having a lot of discomfort doing scans .\\nWe decided we would hold off on that and discuss her with Radiation Oncology instead.\\nI discussed the case informally with Dr. Person6 who said he would consider radiation therapy to that focal area as the existing scans are suspicious enough.\\nThe patient has some medication at home that she does not know the name of the Dr. Person50 prescribed for pain.\\nShe has not started that yet.\\nShe has basically alternating ibuprofen with Tylenol.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer underlying history of malignancy is as follows.\\nRecently, she noticed some changes in her left nipple noted it was inverted and that her left breast felt \"lumpier\"\\nand flatter.\\nShe thought she initially developed \"a rash on her left breast.\"\\nShe brought this to the attention of her\\nhealthcare providers on September 18.\\nShe underwent a mammogram that showed an increased density in the subareolar tissue in the upper outer quadrant of the breast.\\nDiffuse skin thickening was seen.\\nTwo soft tissue masses were seen in the breast.\\nThe patient had an ultrasound of her breast that revealed multiple suspicious masses in the left breast.\\n A lymph node in the left axilla was seen.\\nThe patient underwent punch biopsies of her skin that showed adenocarcinoma involving the dermal lymphatics.\\nShe also had an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy that showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma, poorly differentiated, as well as some DCIS.\\nER was positive, PR was negative, HER-2/neu was amplified.\\nThe patient had the above-mentioned staging workup.\\nShe is here to discuss her to start her chemotherapy.\\nShe offers no new questions and did not need any prescriptions.\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, aspirin, omega-3, vitamin D, vitamin B12, B complex, gluten, Tylenol, over-the-counter allergy meds, Avastin injections in her eye, ibuprofen, Coumadin to keep her port open, Decadron premeds for chemo, Compazine and some medication that Dr. Person50 prescribed that she does not know the name of but will call in.\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO NUMEROUS THINGS INCLUDING PENICILLIN, SULFA, MORPHINE, DEMEROL, SACCHARINE, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, PORK AND COFFEE.\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No new visual problems.\\nNo nosebleeds, no gum bleed, usual dyspnea on exertion, no substernal chest pain, no palpitations.\\nHer breast has not changed much in the past few days since she was last seen here on October 9th.\\nShe does have that rib pain and some back pain exacerbated by putting her hands over her head.\\nNo weight loss, no vaginal bleeding., no rectal bleeding. No neurologic symptoms\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nGENERAL:  Shows a pleasant elderly lady.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  98.2. 76, 18, 160/87, 162 pounds, 95% on room air.\\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nExtraocular movements intact.\\nOropharynx, no lesion.\\nLUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds at the base.\\nBACK:  No spinal tenderness.\\nHEART:  Regular, occasional premature beat.\\nHer left breast is firm and red.\\nThe nipple is inverted and it has not really changed much since I last examined her.\\nGENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\nEXTREMITIES:  No edema.\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  MUGA scan 4 cm left ventricular aneurysm, ejection fraction is 50%.\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nA 77-year-old woman with a host of cardiac issues who has inflammatory breast cancer.\\nThe punch biopsy of the skin as well as a biopsy shows adenocarcinoma of the breast.\\nThere is\\nevidence of dermal lymphatic invasion on her punch biopsy.\\n There is\\nevidence of enlarged lymph nodes on her scans .\\nThe tumor is ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nWe are going to treat her as inflammatory breast cancer.\\nWe are going to go ahead and do Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nShe does have that worrisome lesion at T4.\\nIt was seen on a PET scan and a bone scan, and she is clinically symptomatic.\\nShe can not\\nhave an MRI because of the pacemaker.\\nI discussed the case informally with Dr. Person6.\\nAt this point, I am not going to put her through another CAT scan.\\nDr. Person6 can see her.\\nHe can decide if it is clinically suspicious enough and he can do the\\nradiation planning type scan .\\nDr. Person6 assures me that I do not have to interrupt my chemotherapy if the patient would undergo this brief course of radiation.\\nAs she does have bone mets we will probably give her some Zometa as well at some point.\\n2..\\nVentricular aneurysm seen on MUGA scan.\\nI did discuss the case with Dr. Person17, her cardiologist.\\nDr. Person17 reviewed her records.\\nDr. Person17 says that her apex has been hypokinetic and may have been a little worse\\nsince the last study, but\\nthis will NOT\\npreclude us from treating her.\\nWe will simply monitor her closely.\\nShe needs the MUGA scan every 3 months anyway while she is on Herceptin.\\nSo she is hemodynamically and clinically stable.\\nShe has aggressive breast cancer that needs to be treated in a timely manner.\\nWe will just go ahead and treat her today.\\nWe will treat her today, Neulasta tomorrow.\\nI will see her back in a week.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson34, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person34, MD on 10/16/2012 at 08:57 AM\\n\\n\\nD:  10/15/2012 03:10PM, DP\\nT:  10/16/2012 04:24AM, in\\nR:  10/16/2012 08:57AM\\n Confirmation #: 551245 / Document ID: 888113\\n\\n\\ncc: Person51 MD\\n Person24 M.D.\\n Person241 M.D.\\n Person82 MD\\n Person457, PhD, FACRO\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '3@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '4@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '5@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '6@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '7@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '8@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '9@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '10@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', '11@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['Herceptin', 'Taxotere', 'carboplatin', 'chemotherapy', 'Avastin', 'Taxotere', 'carboplatin', 'Herceptin', 'chemotherapy', 'Zometa'], 'span': [[867, 876], [878, 886], [892, 903], [3094, 3106], [3313, 3320], [5184, 5192], [5194, 5205], [5210, 5219], [5693, 5705], [5825, 5831]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['12@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['at some point'], 'span': [[5840, 5853]], 'id': [0]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient114_report028_NOTE@gold', 'ment': '20121015', 'span': [230, 238]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report042_NOTE': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................1642,6Ag3zTO8PtKV\\nPatient ID....................6Ag3zTO8PtKV\\nPatient Name..................Patient114\\nPrincipal Date................20121204\\nRecord Type...................NOTE\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\nPATIENT NAME: Patient114\\nPATIENT ID#: \\nDATE OF BIRTH: 06/19/1935\\nDATE OF VISIT: 12/04/2012\\n\\n\\nOffice Note\\n\\nREASON FOR VISIT:  1.\\nThe patient awoke today with left rib pain and left shoulder pain and increased shortness of breath.

PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient114 is a 77-year-old woman with a host of medical problems who has a left-sided inflammatory breast cancer with a solitary metastasis to her thoracic spine.\\nShe has completed radiation therapy to the solitary met to the thoracic spine.\\nShe also is receiving neoadjuvant therapy with Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin.\\nBecause she was so symptomatic from her thoracic spine metastasis, she received limited field radiation.\\nShe is responding nicely to her chemotherapy.\\nHer breast looks much less red.\\nThe nipple is no longer inverted and the mass in her breast is much smaller and softer.\\nUnfortunately, the patient has had problems with her blood counts requiring both transfusions and dose reductions in her chemo.\\nIn fact on November 12, her hematocrit dropped to 24 and given her heart disease, she was symptomatic with shortness of breath and we had to transfuse her.\\nMost recently her platelet count as of yesterday was still 87 and it was our expectation that we would hold off on her chemotherapy and check it again in a week.\\nThe patient awoke from sleep today with pain in her left chest wall area.\\nThis was so severe that it \"took her breath away.\"\\nShe had not had hemoptysis.\\nShe had not had purulent sputum.\\nShe said the\\npain was worse with moving her arm.\\nThe pain was alleviated by moving her breast around.\\nShe then experienced palpitations.\\nShe did not have substernal chest pain.\\nShe does not remember injuring her shoulder or her ribs.\\nShe said after getting radiation to her thoracic spine, her back got better, but now she did have some discomfort near her scapula.\\nShe has never had a blood clot.\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, aspirin, PreserVision, omega-3 fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B, Lutein, Avastin injections in her eye, Decadron on her chemo days, Ultram for pain, Prilosec, Compazine, nystatin, MBX.\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO NUMEROUS THINGS INCLUDING PENICILLIN, SULFA, CARDURA, MORPHINE, DEMEROL, SACCHARIN, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, POLY-IRON, PORK AND COFFEE.\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and are unchanged.\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No visual problems, no nosebleeds, no mouth pain, no increased coughing, no substernal chest pain, no increased shortness of breath, no pain in the breast itself.\\nShe does have some rib pain.\\nShe has some shoulder pain.\\nIt hurts to pick up her arm over her head.\\nShe also has some pain by her left scapula.\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows an anxious lady with alopecia.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.3, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 159/89, 160 pounds, 100% on room air.\\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and

spine.\\nHEART:  Regular, occasional premature beat.\\nBREASTS:  Left breast looks less red.\\nThe nipple is everted now.\\nThere is no skin breakdown.\\nSubjectively tender to palpation over her mid axillary line rib cage.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft.\\nEXTREMITIES:  No edema.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Intact.\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 108, bicarbonate 28, BUN 20, creatinine 1.02.\\nHer troponins today is 0.37.\\nWhite count 6.1, hematocrit 31.8, platelets of 101.\\nD-dimer came back at 2.97.\\n\\n RADIOGRAPHIC REVIEW:  CTA of the chest shows no pulmonary embolism, mildly displaced fracture of the lateral aspect of the fourth rib, compression fracture T4, shoulder x-ray, no evidence of shoulder fracture, mild DJD, acute fracture 4th.\\nRib x-ray, acute fracture fourth left rib.\\nChest x-ray, post-surgical change, cardiomegaly, no acute cardiopulmonary disease.\\nInterval occurrence of a severe T5 compression fracture, which occurred since October.\\nEKG sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular complexes, right bundle-branch block, left anterior fascicular block, abnormal EKG.\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 77-year-old woman who showed up here today with new onset of chest pain that seemed a little pleuritic in nature.\\nHer troponin was negative.\\nHer D-dimer was up.\\nWe were obligated to check a CTA of the chest.\\nFortunately, that showed no pulmonary embolism.\\nUnfortunately, however, it appears she has a new rib fracture and a new compression fracture.\\nRecall, this is a lady who initially had a solitary met to T4 and just underwent radiation.\\nWe gave her some oxycodone.\\nWe are going to set her up to see Dr. Person6 in Location for consideration of kyphoplasty.\\n The EKG is abnormal, but not more so than it has been.\\nI do not think her acute problem is cardiac disease.\\nWe will forward this letter to Dr. Person50, who follows her closely for her cardiac issues.\\nIn terms of her breast cancer, her platelet count was quite low.\\nShe was quite anemic and required a blood transfusion.\\nWe are going to modestly dose reduced her again.\\nThis will be her second dose reduction . .\\nIt would probably behoove us to

a complicated cardiac history is a host of medical problems who is here to discuss recent restaging studies that she had.\\nI last saw her on March 11 and I discussed with her and her family the next approaches to the treatment of her breast cancer.\\nHer underlying history is as follows:  She developed left-sided inflammatory breast cancer.\\nShe underwent initially a biopsy in September 2012 that confirmed breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nOn her initial workup there appeared to be a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nShe received radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion.\\nShe had been receiving neoadjuvant Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nLast dose was administered January 8, 2013.\\nShe had difficulty with this regimen.\\nThere had to be dose delays and dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia.\\nWe carefully monitored her compromised ejection fraction by MUGA\\nwhile she is on Herceptin.\\nA MUGA scan showed a decrease in her ejection fraction.\\nBy January 30th, her ejection fraction went from 49 to 44.\\nThat was enough decline in her ejection fraction that we had to hold the Herceptin.\\nAlthough she responded to this regimen in so far as clinically her breast exam improved, we thought perhaps we did receive our maximum response.\\nFurthermore, her compromised blood work and a compromised\\nejection fraction probably limited how much more systemic therapy we were able to administer.\\nSo after a long discussion with the patient, we elected to send her for a mastectomy.\\nThe mastectomy was performed February 20th.\\nAt the time of the mastectomy, an invasive ductal carcinoma, 3.7 cm, grade III was seen.\\nDCIS was also seen.\\nThe margins were negative, 5/14 lymph nodes were positive.\\nExtensive lymphatic tumor invasion was identified.\\nThe pathologic stage was a T2 N2 Mx.\\nThe patient had some problems with shortness of breath postop and a CTA of the chest was done that showed no pulmonary emboli, but did show her known ventricular aneurysm, her aortic valve replacement and a pleural effusion.\\nIn the body of that report, the radiologist said the heart appeared to be further increased in size.\\nThe patient was able to be discharged from the hospital.\\nShe presents today.\\nHer JP drain is finally out.\\nShe remains more short of breath and tired.\\nWhen she was here on March 11th, Radiation Oncology discussed with her the possibility of doing radiation, but to do that she would have had to have her pacemaker moved to her right chest.\\nIn the interim, she has not had a chance to discuss this with Dr. Person6 in the interim.\\n\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B, Lutein, Avastin eye injections, ibuprofen, Ultram, Prilosec.\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA, CARDURA, MORPHINE, DEMEROL, SACCHARIN, POLY IRON, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, PORK, COFFEE AND GINGER.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\n\\n FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has not had fevers or chills.\\nShe does have weakness and fatigue.\\nShe has not had any new visual problems, yellowing of her eyes or blurry vision.\\nShe does have chronic macular degeneration and gets Avastin drops.\\nShe has not had decreased hearing or nasal\\ncongestion.\\nShe is more short of breath.\\nShe is not coughing or bringing up any sputum.\\nShe does not notice chest pain or palpitations.\\nShe is happy to have her drain taken out of mastectomy site.\\nShe has not had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.\\nShe has not had dysuria or hematuria.\\nShe has not noticed any swollen glands.\\nShe has not had a fever.\\nShe has no new joint pain.\\nShe has not had a rash or any skin breakdown.\\nShe has not had any confusion, numbness or tingling.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows a lady in no acute distress.\\n VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.4, pulse 72, respirations 14, blood pressure 175/86, weight 148 pounds, 94% on room air.\\nShe is alert and oriented in no acute distress.\\n HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round and react to light and accommodation.\\nNormal conjunctiva.\\nMoist oral mucosa.\\nNo pharyngeal erythema.\\n NECK:  Supple, no JVD, no bruit.\\n LUNGS:  Increased kyphotic curve.\\nDiminished breath sounds at the base.\\n HEART:  Regular, occasional premature beat.\\n CHEST:  She is status post mastectomy, incision looks good.\\n ABDOMEN:  Soft, positive bowel sounds.\\n MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Trace edema.\\n SKIN:  No lesions.\\n NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented.\\nNormal sensory, normal motor.\\n\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 142, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarbonate 27, creatinine 1.13, ALT 18, AST 21, alk phos 76, iron is 40, TIBC is 423, iron sat 9.5, ferritin 77.\\nWhite count 8.4, hematocrit 28.5, platelets of 99.\\n\\n\\n RADIOGRAPHIC REVIEW:  Her bone scan showed increased uptake in compressed T4 vertebra consistent with metastatic disease and pathologic fracture, increased uptake in fourth rib, simple fracture on CAT scan.\\nCAT scan of the abdomen recent mastectomy, cardiomegaly, scarring at the lung bases, persistent cholelithiasis, no metastatic lesions.\\nCT of the pelvis, no acute process.\\nMUGA scan shows an ejection fraction of 45%, which is\\nsimilar to prior MUGA scan.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nAn elderly 77-year-old lady with a host of comorbid problems who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine that was radiated.\\nShe had 4 cycles of neoadjuvant Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nIdeally, we had wanted to do 6.\\nHowever, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after 4 cycles of this, we thought we obtained maximum benefits.\\nWe sent her for surgery.\\nEven after the maximum amount of chemotherapy and Herceptin she could tolerate, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThis per se is stage IIIA disease.\\nHowever, I reminded the patient that she had a bone metastasis at presentation.\\nShe had a solitary bone lesion, so\\ntechnically she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nToday, I went over the patient's CAT scan of the abdomen and her bone scan as well as her MUGA scan.\\nGiven the MUGA scan findings, I do not think we could do any more Herceptin.\\nThis lady is short of breath and tired.\\nI do not know if the effort it would take to move the pacemaker to the other side and then do radiation to her left chest would be worth the downside consequences.\\nI encouraged her to discuss it with Dr. Person6, her cardiologist.\\nEvidently, this lady's pacemaker insertion was quite complicated because of her previous chest procedures.\\nShe had to go all the way to the Institution to have her pacemaker replaced, so certainly she needs to carefully consider having this procedure done again.\\nI think for the time being, I am going to start her on Arimidex because she is ER positive.\\nRealistically I am not sure if her ejection fraction will ever be good enough that I can administer any more HERCEPTIN.\\nIf after discussing her case with Dr.\\nPerson6, she decides to have her pacemaker moved to the opposite side, I will send her back to radiation, but for now, I reminded her that she had stage IV disease and if one believes the initial positive bone mets and therefore treating a lady with stage IV disease in bone mets with hormone therapy alone certainly does not seem unreasonable.\\nI did the teaching for Arimidex and I gave her a prescription for Arimidex.\\nI am concerned about the possibility of worsening osteopenia in this lady, but of course she is already on Zometa for the presumed bone metastasis.\\n 2.\\nBone metastasis as above.\\nShe will continue her weekly Zometa.\\nThis should hopefully prevent further more aromatase inhibitor osteopenia.\\n 3.\\nAnemia with abnormal iron stores.\\nWe are going to give her some iron IV.\\nShe is INTOLERANT OF ORAL IRON.\\nWe will correct her iron stores intravenously and see if that brings her counts up.\\nI asked her if she had a recent gastrointestinal workup and she told me she never had a colonoscopy.\\nAt this point, I do not think she is up for one.\\nI will just give her some stool Hemoccults.\\nSo in summary, stool Hemoccults, IV iron and I will see her with her next Zometa.\\nShe is going to go back to Dr. Person6 to get Dr. Person6's opinion about this movement of pacemaker to the opposite side.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson36,

T7.\\n 2.\\nChest CT of October 6th, slight increase in small right pleural effusion; increased size of soft tissue density lateral base of the lung, which could be atelectasis or infiltrate; chronic pleural parenchymal disease; old compression deformity at T4; new sclerotic lesion at T7; persistent cholelithiasis; old scarring of the kidney; splenic calcifications; sclerotic .\\n 3.\\nMUGA scan October 1st, ejection fraction of 53%.\\n 4.\\nMammogram September 15th, no evidence of malignancy.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a 79-year-old woman with significant cardiac disease.\\nShe initially presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine at presentation; therefore, she had stage IV incurable disease at presentation.\\nHer previous therapies and all their attendant complications and side effects are reviewed above.\\nShe was recently reevaluated.\\nFortunately, she still does not have visceral metastasis.\\nFortunately, her ejection fraction remains actually good for her.\\nIn the past because of her age, her comorbidities and her marginal blood counts, when she progressed in bone, we simply radiated it and\\ncontinued the same regimen of Zometa and Faslodex.\\nUnfortunately, she continues to inexorably progress in bone.\\nFortunately, her ejection fraction is better.\\nI presented several options to her and her family.\\nOne option would be to move on to a different hormonal regimen such as Megace or tamoxifen, but as her ejection fraction is actually quite good, perhaps we ought to try another anti-HER-2 agent. Consistent with Institution Pathways in this setting, she might be a candidate for Kadcyla.\\nThe rationale for this was explained to the patient, her husband and daughter.\\nThey were given handouts on Kadcyla.\\nThey consented to Kadcyla.\\nAs she has already had marginal blood counts, we are going to modestly dose reduce the Kadcyla.\\nWe will administer Kadcyla every 3 weeks.\\nWe will follow her tumor markers.\\nIf she tolerates the Kadcyla, we will reevaluate her after about 4 cycles.\\nAs this is an HER-2/neu agent and can affect her cardiac status, likewise after probably about 4 cycles of Kadcyla, in other words in about 3 months, we will get another MUGA scan.\\n 2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nShe is already on Zometa, they keep progressing.\\nWe are going to refer her to Radiation.\\nShe can NOT\\nhave an MRI of her thoracic spine because of various issues.( pacer wires still in etc)\\n We are going to switch her from Zometa\\nto Xgeva, maybe that would work better.\\n 3.\\nAnemia.\\nHer haptoglobin looks good.\\nWe will cut her prednisone back.\\nWe will see what her CBC is doing, she may need a transfusion.\\nHer last total iron level was only 31 and that was September 30th.\\nShe did receive iron on October 2nd.\\nWe will repeat her CBC and iron stores.\\n 4.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nPlatelets look good, but of course she is on steroids.\\n 5.\\nWhite count, again better with the steroids, starting to drop as we taper it down.\\nBecause her white count is already marginal, we are going to modestly reduce the Kadcyla.\\n6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nShe has a port in.\\n 7.\\nCardiac issues, plans as per Dr. Person6.\\n\\n\\n Greater than half an hour was spent with the patient, her daughter and her husband and more than 50% of time spent on counseling.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson36, MD\\nInstitution at Institution\\n\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person36, MD on 10/20/2014 at 03:22 PM\\n\\n\\nD:  10/13/2014

The patient had radiation therapy to bone mets at the base of skull.\\n17.  Faslodex continued because the patient tolerated the regimen well and\\n*U*P*M*C* Patient114#:\\nshe just had that marginal progression in bone.\\n18.  The patient had a bone scan and CAT scan on October 6th showing\\nprogression in bone.  The patient\\'s most recent MUGA scan October 1st\\nshowed improved ejection fraction, therefore new regimen of Kadcyla was\\ninitiated.  The Zometa was changed to Xgeva.\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient114 is a fragile, elderly lady\\nwith a host of comorbid medical problems who is in the midst of radiation\\ntherapy under the direction of Dr. Person62.  The patient has a\\nchronically compromised bone marrow and marginal blood counts.  On November\\n3rd, she was noted to have a hematocrit of 25.1.  The expectation was she\\nwould be brought in, slowly transfused a unit of blood and given Lasix.\\nThe patient arrived 11/5/14 for the stated purpose of receiving her radiation\\nand getting a blood transfusion.  She was markedly short of breath therefore\\nthe patient was sent for inpatient evaluation.  The patient is currently being\\nmonitored.  With transfusion, her hematocrit has gone from 23 to 33. The\\npatient has had a series of cardiac enzymes drawn, the last troponin being most\\nelevated at 0.143.  The patient\\'s EKG of November 5th did show a right bundle-\\nbranch block and left anterior fascicular block.  The patient\\'s chest x-ray\\nshows cardiomegaly.  With the interventions of diuresis and blood transfusion\\non date of service, November 6th, the patient is less short of breath.  She\\ndenies chest pain or palpitations. She denies any problems with her remaining\\nbreast.  She denies any back pain to the site where she is getting radiation\\ntherapy.  She denies any jaw pain from getting Xgeva.  She denies bruising or\\nbleeding.  The patient\\'s anemia is felt to be multifactorial.  She has been\\nnoted to have abnormal iron stores.  We have been repleting her with Venofer.\\nShe last had Venofer on October 2nd.  She does not have overt GI bleeding or\\nvaginal bleeding.  A gastrointestinal workup has been deferred secondary to her\\nmultiple comorbid medical problems.  She also may have an element of\\nhemolysis.  She does have a low haptoglobin level, and she has been treated\\nempirically with steroids and folic acid with occasional benefit.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for valvular heart disease, coronary\\nartery disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism and GERD.  She has had a CABG,\\nporcine valve, left mastectomy, left knee surgery.\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Synthroid, Zofran, Lasix, nitro, aspirin,\\ncholecalciferol, vitamin B, folic acid, Lasix, omega-3 and prednisone.\\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO MULTIPLE MEDS INCLUDING SULFA, PENICILLIN,\\nMORPHINE, DEMEROL, CARDURA, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, GINGER, POLYTRIM, NUTRASWEET,\\nCOFFEE.  SHE DID NOT TOLERATE ANASTROZOLE.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married.  She lives with her husband.  She is a\\nretired secretary.  She quit smoking about 40 years ago.  She does not\\ndrink.\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Father died of lymphoma.  Father died of coronary artery\\ndisease.\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see interim history.  Otherwise, a 10-point\\nreview of systems performed and is negative.\\n*U*P*M*C* Patient114#:\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\nGENERAL:  Shows an elderly lady who looks comfortable at rest with a vague\\naffect.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  36.8, 185/99, 85, 20, 93, 68 kilos, afebrile.\\nHEENT:  Steroid facies. Sclerae are anicteric, conjunctivae pale.  Nares,\\nno lesion.\\nNECK:  No nodes, no JVD, no bruit.\\nLUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds at the base.\\nBACK:  Increased kyphotic curve.\\nHEART:  Regular, blowing systolic murmur.\\nBREAST EXAM:  Status post mastectomy.  Telangiectasias over the scar.  No\\nobvious dermal mets.  Opposite breast is pendulous, atrophic.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft, positive bowel sounds.  No guarding, no rebound.\\nLYMPHATICS:  No lymphadenopathy.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  Thoracic kyphosis, changes consistent with arthritis.\\nSKIN:  Warm, dry, pink.  No obvious dermal mets.\\nNEUROLOGIC EXAM:  Alert, oriented, vague affect.\\nLABORATORIES:  Her sodium is 141, potassium 3.8, chloride 103, bicarbonate\\n32, BUN 25, creatinine 1.48, glucose 97.  Troponin 0.143.  White count 3.5,\\nhematocrit 33, platelets of 86.  BNP is 1270.\\nRADIOGRAPHIC REVIEW:  Chest x-ray November 5th cardiomegaly, pulmonary\\nvascular congestion.  EKG November 5th sinus tach with occasional\\nconsecutive PACs, right bundle-branch block, left anterior fascicular\\nblock.  Her last MUGA scan was October 1st marked degree of cardiomegaly,\\nleft atrial enlargement, overall ejection fraction at 53%.\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\\n1.  Elderly lady with an extensive cardiac history who was admitted with\\nincreased shortness of breath, acute and chronic systolic and diastolic\\ncongestive heart failure.  She was markedly anemic when she came in, she\\nwas transfused, she was diuresed, she looks more comfortable.  She has\\npositive cardiac enzymes and is being monitored. She is a patient of Dr Person108.\\n2.  Metastatic breast cancer.  She was last evaluated by scans in October.\\nThe scans showed progressive disease in bone.  The MUGA scan showed\\nimproved ejection fraction.  After an extensive discussion, the patient\\nwished to go back on anti HER2/neu agents.  Therefore, in the metastatic\\nsetting, we started Kadcyla.  She had 1 dose of Kadcyla October 21st.  We\\nwill defer on further systemic interventions of this nature until her\\ncardiac status is stabilized.  Perhaps given her tenuous cardiac status,\\nshe may not tolerate these anti HER2 agents and may be a candidate for\\nhormonal blocking therapy alone.  She has progressed through aromatase\\ninhibitors.  She has progressed through Faslodex.  Perhaps, a trial of\\ntamoxifen might be all this elderly lady might be able to tolerate.\\n3.  Anemia symptomatically better after transfusion.  She is on steroids\\nfor an element of hemolysis.  She has received Venofer in the past.  We\\nwill follow her CBC.  She has received chemotherapy in the past.  Perhaps\\nher bone marrow is compromised on that basis.  Clearly, her marginal blood\\ncounts will also further dissuade us from any further aggressive\\nintervention in her breast cancer.\\n4.  Thrombocytopenia, ongoing problem, we will monitor her platelet count.\\n5.  Pain from bone mets.  She appears well palliated.  Dr. Person19 will resume\\nradiation when she is deemed medically ready.  Perhaps, a Palliative Care\\n*U*P*M*C* Patient114#:\\nconsult to help better define the goals of care in this complicated patient\\nwould be warranted.\\n______________________________\\nElectronically authenticated at end of document.\\nDictated by: Person3, MD\\nD:  11/06/2014 12:07PM, DP T:  11/06/2014 01:39PM, pn\\nR:\\nConfirmation #

has not had rashes, abrasions or skin breakdown.\\nHer port is not functioning per the patient.\\nShe has not had abnormal balance, headache, numbness or tingling.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows an anxious, elderly lady.\\nShe is alert and oriented in no acute distress.\\n VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, pulse 75, respirations 16, blood pressure 198/89, weight 141 pounds, 96% on room air.\\n HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.\\nNares, no discharge.\\nOropharynx, no lesion.\\n NECK:  No nodes.\\n SPINE:  Markedly kyphotic curve.\\nNo point

looks good.\\nThere are a few small red spots above the incision.\\nThere is no obvious dermal mets.\\nThe opposite breast is without masses.\\n ABDOMEN:  Soft.\\n RECTAL:  Deferred.\\n GENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\n EXTREMITIES:  Trace edema.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.\\n\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 142, potassium 4.5, chloride 107, bicarbonate 30, BUN is 23, creatinine is 1.29, adjusted calcium 9.8, bilirubin 0.4, SGPT 21.\\nSGOT 29, alkaline phosphatase is 77.\\nWhite count 3, hematocrit 35, platelets of 99.\\n\\n\\n RADIOGRAPHIC REVIEW:  June 12th, 2013, MUGA scan, mild cardiomegaly, ejection fraction of 49.\\nPET scan, June 10th, 2013, there is a small focal area of abnormal activity in the right supraclavicular area of uncertain etiology.\\nThis appears to be associated with a partially calcified abnormality making it unlikely to represent malignant lymphadenopathy.\\nThere is minimal activity associated with patient\\'s known pathologic fracture T4.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a 77-year-old woman with a host of comorbid medical problems, who presented with inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nThus, she had stage IV breast cancer at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to the solitary metastatic lesion.\\nShe had four cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nIdeally, a six were planned.\\nHowever, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia as well as a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after four cycles, we thought we had obtained maximal benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress.\\nShe went for surgery.\\nEven after this course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she barely tolerated, she had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nPer se, this was stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she had bone metastasis at presentation, so technically she has stage IV breast cancer.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nHer CAT scans and bone scans showed a solitary metastasis to her thoracic spine.\\nI reviewed all those scans with her.\\nI thought it\\nwould be difficult to administer chest wall radiation because of the pacemaker on that side.\\nEven if it were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put it on the other side, one would still have to be concerned about compromising her already challenged respiratory status and her left ventricular aneurysm by radiating the chest on that side.\\nShe considered the downside of all this and elected not to do radiation.\\nIn the meantime, her counts are marginal and her ejection fraction was down.\\nThus, we did not administer radiation.\\nFurthermore, we elected not to give her any Herceptin.\\nWe placed her on aromatase inhibitors.\\nShe was poorly tolerant of the Arimidex.\\nShe seems to be marginally tolerating her Aromasin.\\nFor now, we will continue the Aromasin.\\nThe results of the PET scan were shared with the patient and her family.\\nThe PET scan was shown on the computer to the patient and her family.\\nThe patient and her family were given a copy of her PET scan and her MUGA scan.\\nHer ejection fraction has come back to baseline.\\nTherefore, I said one option if we wanted to be more aggressive would be to administer Herceptin alone.\\nWe would administer Herceptin alone every three weeks for 11 cycles.\\nThat would be the standard approach to this disease process.\\nOf course, we have to worry about ongoing issues with her compromised ejection fraction.\\nThe patient gave it careful consideration and wants to do the Herceptin.\\nUnfortunately, her port is not functioning well.\\nAfter we reestablish better vascular access, we will do Herceptin every three weeks x11 cycles.\\nWe will monitor her cardiac function closely.\\nShe will be due for another MUGA scan in mid September.\\nWe will continue the Aromasin, of course, concomitant concurrently with Herceptin.\\n 2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nShe will get her monthly Zometa.\\nEvidently, the infusion room nurses will try to administer it peripherally because her\\nport is not working.\\n 3.\\nCardiac issues:  As above.\\nIt is encouraging that her MUGA scan looks better.\\nWe had a talk about the pluses and minuses of doing more Herceptin as her ejection fraction is better, we probably cautiously administer Herceptin alone.\\n 4.\\nAnemia with abnormal iron stores.\\nHer latest hematocrit looks stable.\\nWe will follow her iron stores.\\n 5.\\nPersistently low white count, no worse than it has been.\\n 6.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nPlatelets are stable.\\n 7.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nHer port evidently is not working.\\nShe was going to see the surgeons to get it out.\\nIf we are entertaining doing Herceptin alone, she needs vascular access.\\nWe will contact the surgeons about the possibility of reinserting another port after the old one that is not

cycles.\\n 2.\\nBone mets status post radiation to the thoracic spine at T4.\\nThe patient is on Zometa.\\n 3.\\nAnemia.\\n 4.\\nCompression fracture.\\n 5.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\n\\n\\n\\n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient114 is a 77-year-old woman with a host of medical problems including cardiac disease and a pacemaker who has had 4 cycles of Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nThis has required several dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia as well as anemia that in the past required a transfusion.\\nShe presents today.\\nShe has several complaints.\\nShe does feel more tired than normal.\\nShe has not had any chest pain.\\nShe is a little more short of breath.\\nShe has not coughed up any blood or any phlegm.\\nShe has macular degeneration and is on Avastin, but she thinks her eyesight is getting worse and her perception of what is going is that her ophthalmologist who prescribes the Avastin says that is not her macular degeneration that is making her eyesight worse.\\nShe has cracked skin and occasionally her fingers bleed, but it is self-limited and sometimes when she blows her nose, she sees a little bit of blood.\\nShe has not had any sustained weakness.\\nIn terms of her breast, she has not had any reddening or skin breakdown.\\nIn terms of her compression fracture, she has just taken Ultram.\\nShe states sometimes it hurts, but nothing sustained.\\n\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B, Lutein, Tylenol, Avastin eyedrops, Prilosec, nystatin, MBX, oxycodone.\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA, CARDURA, MORPHINE,\\nDEMEROL, SACCHARIN,.Plavix, Flagyl, pork, coffee, AND ginger.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see history of present illness.\\nShe thinks her vision is a little worse.\\nSometimes she has little streak of blood in her nasal discharge.\\nShe does not have mouth sores.\\nShe does feel more short of breath.\\nShe does not have hemoptysis.\\nShe does not have pleuritic chest pain.\\nShe does not have substernal chest pain.\\nShe does not have abdominal pain.\\nShe does not have vaginal bleeding.\\nShe does not have vaginal discharge.\\nIn terms of her compression fracture, she has occasional back pain.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows an anxious lady.\\n VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, pulse 77, respirations 16, blood pressure 180/84, weight 153, saturating 94% on room air.\\n HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nNares, no discharge.\\nOropharynx, no lesion.\\n LUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds at the base, markedly increased kyphotic curve.\\n HEART:  Regular.\\n ABDOMEN:  Soft.\\n EXTREMITIES:  No edema.\\n BREASTS:  The nipple on the left is now everted.\\nThere is still a mass palpable under the nipple that is about 2 cm across.\\nThere is no new red lesion on the breast.\\nThere is no palpable axillary adenopathy.\\n\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  Her white count is 4.4, hematocrit 28.7, and platelets of 78.\\nSodium 141, potassium 4, chloride 105, bicarbonate 29, BUN 18, creatinine 1.03.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nLeft-sided inflammatory breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified by FISH.\\nThe patient has had four cycles of Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin.\\nShe has had multiple dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia.\\nShe is now three weeks out from her fourth cycle and her platelet count is still low.\\nHopefully, her platelets will recover\\nand we will treat her next week.\\nHer breast does not look any worse nor better than last cycle\\n.\\nI do not know how much additional benefit we are getting by pushing these additional cycles of chemo.\\nPerhaps we have reached maximal benefit of this regimen and when we decide that is the case, we should send her for mastectomy.\\nIn an ideal world, we would have liked it done to do 6 cycles and then sent her for surgery, but with the dose reductions and still having thrombocytopenia, I do not know how much additional benefit we are going to get by prolonging this course of chemotherapy, but for now we will see what things look like and hopefully treat her next week.\\nAt some point, if she is medically cleared to have surgery, she would have a salvage mastectomy.\\nI explained again to the patient and her family that under the \"usual\" circumstances afterwards, she would have had radiation to her chest wall.\\nAs she has left-sided breast cancer and a left-sided pacemaker, I will defer to Dr. Person6 if that would even be feasible after a mastectomy.\\nAfterwards, other interventions in this lady might include every 3-week Herceptin to complete a year of therapy and then hormone blocking therapy, but for now, we will just wait until next week and see what her platelet count does.\\n 2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nShe is status post limited radiation to T4.\\nShe is going to get Zometa next week.\\nShe does have a compression fracture, but conservative measurements for all looked in order.\\nHer pain seems well controlled with Ultram.\\nShe fortunately did not need a kyphoplasty.\\n 3.\\nAnemia.\\nHematocrit looks stable.\\n 4.\\nCardiac issues.\\nPlan is as per Dr. Person50.\\nAbout three months are gone by since her last MUGA, so we will order another one.\\n 5.\\nVisual issues. We will continue to observe.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson93, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person93, MD on 01/29/2013 at 11:10 PM\\nD:  01/28/2013 10:50AM, DP\\nT:  01/29/2013

amplified breast cancer.\\nShe had a solitary bone met at presentation.\\nThe patient underwent radiation to her thoracic spine.\\nThe patient received systemic chemotherapy with Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin.\\nShe received four cycles of that in the \"neoadjuvant setting.\"\\nShe ran into problems with her blood counts as well as a decline in her ejection fraction.\\nFortunately, her breast mass regressed.\\nShe was able to undergo surgery.\\nEven with the maximally tolerated amount of chemotherapy, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nA recent PET scan done on June 10 showed only activity in the right supraclavicular area of uncertain etiology as well as some minimal uptake in her thoracic spine where she was radiated.\\nAs the patient no longer had overt measurable disease, we decided we would put her on some maintenance therapy.\\nWe had discussed radiation therapy to her left chest wall.\\nHowever, she has a pacemaker on her left side.\\nAfter a lot of discussion, we elected not to move the pacemaker, we elected not to do radiation therapy to her chest wall.\\nRecall, she technically had stage IV disease at presentation anyway because of the bone mets.\\nWe put her on Aromasin.\\nShe tolerates that marginally well,\\ncauses a lot of hot flashes and emotional lability.\\nWe repeated her MUGA scan, her ejection fraction looks better, so we decided we would put her back on Herceptin.\\nIt is our hopeful expectation that we can get in 11 cycles of every three-week Herceptin without compromising her already diminished ejection fraction.\\nShe will remain on the Aromasin.\\nShe gets Zometa for bone metastasis.\\nShe presents today, her port was clogged and had to be replaced.\\nShe tolerated that procedure reasonably well.\\nShe continues to complain of some neck pain when she works too much.\\nThe port insertion site was a little sore.\\nHer shortness of breath is no worse than it had been.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, fish oil, vitamins, Lutein, Aromasin, magnesium, levothyroxine and ICaps.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA,

SYSTEMS:  Her review of systems is exactly the same as the note of June 13th.\\nAll questions were re-asked, and the answers are unchanged.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows an anxious lady in no acute distress.\\nShe is alert and oriented, in no acute distress.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, pulse 76, respirations 16, blood pressure 156/72, weight 141 pounds, O2 saturation 95%.\\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nNormal hearing, moist oral mucosa, no pharyngeal erythema.\\nNECK:  Supple, no bruit, no JVD, no thyromegaly.\\nLUNGS:

Deferred.\\nGENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\nEXTREMITIES:  Trace edema.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  June 13th, her sodium was 142, potassium 4.5, chloride 107, bicarbonate 30, BUN 23, creatinine 1.29.\\nHer adjusted calcium is 9.8, white count is 4.1, hematocrit 36.8, platelets of 107.\\nLast iron stores were checked in May.\\nHer total iron was 94.\\nCA 15-3 is 31.\\n\\nRADIOLOGY:  She had a chest x-ray post port placement, no evidence of pneumothorax or cardiomegaly.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a now 78-year-old woman with a significant cardiac history who presented with an inflammatory type of left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe has solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nThus, she has stage IV breast cancer at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to the solitary metastatic lesions.\\nShe had four cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nIdeally six were planned, however, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after four cycles, it was felt she had obtained maximal benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress.\\nShe had surgery.\\nEven with this course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she barely tolerated, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nSo per se, this was stage IIIA breast cancer, however, she had bone metastasis at presentation, so she did have an early stage IV disease.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nHer\\nscans\\nshowed a solitary mets to her thoracic spine.\\nI reviewed all those scans with her.\\nI thought it would be difficult to administer chest wall radiation because the pacemaker is on that left side.\\nEven if it were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put in on the right side, one would still have concerns about compromising her already\\nchallenged respiratory status and she has a left ventricular aneurysm.\\nShe considered the downside of all this and elected not to do radiation.\\nIn the meantime, her counts were marginal and her ejection fraction was down.\\nWe plan no further chemotherapy.\\nAt that time, we did not plan on any further Herceptin.\\nWe put her on Aromasin.\\nShe is tolerating that reasonably well.\\nWe repeated her MUGA scan.\\nHer ejection fraction looks a little better.\\nWe are going to try to administer Herceptin.\\nHer current plan will be Herceptin every three weeks and Aromasin every day.\\nThe patient had her first of planned 11 doses of Herceptin on July 2nd.\\nShe will be back on July 23rd for her next Herceptin.\\nWe will monitor her ejection fraction closely.\\nShe will be due for a MUGA scan in mid September, and we will set that up.\\nShe was also due for a mammogram of her remaining breast in mid September as well.\\nThe patient evidently has a fairly high co-pay for her Aromasin.\\nWe are going to try to get her some financial help.\\n2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nWe are going to give her Zometa every six weeks in other words with every other cycle of Herceptin.\\n3.\\nCardiac issues as above.\\nIt is encouraging her MUGA looks better.\\nWe are going to give her Herceptin and follow her MUGA scan.\\n4.\\nAnemia with abnormal iron stores.\\nLast hematocrit looked quite good, repeat iron stores in the future.\\n5.\\nPersistently low white count, looking better.\\n6.\\nThrombocytopenia, platelets are stable.\\n7.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nHer other port was working.\\nShe has a new port in and it

woman with a complicated cardiac history and a host of medical problems who was last here on April 8th.\\nShe is here a month later.\\nShe is currently on Aromasin for her ER-positive breast cancer.\\nShe gets hot flashes and mood swings and some more joint pain, but otherwise she is tolerating it reasonably well.\\nShe has not noticed any problems with her chest wall.\\nShe is no more short of breath than she had been.\\nShe has not had any abdominal pain or any problems with her opposite breast.\\nHer underlying history of malignancy is as follows:  1.\\nShe developed left-sided\\ninflammatory breast cancer.\\nShe underwent a biopsy in September 2012 that confirmed breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nOn her initial workup, there was a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nThus she had stage IV breast cancer at presentation.\\nShe received radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion.\\nShe then received \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nThe last dose was administered January 8, 2013.\\nShe had difficulty with this regimen.\\nThere were dose delays and dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia.\\nWe carefully monitored her already compromised ejection fraction by MUGA scan while she was receiving Herceptin.\\nHer MUGA scan showed a decrease in her ejection fraction.\\nBy January 2013, her ejection fraction went from 49 to 44.\\nThat was enough\\nof a decline in her ejection fraction that per parameters for Herceptin, we had to hold her Herceptin.\\nEven with the few cycles of chemotherapy, there was regression of her breast mass.\\nSo, after a long discussion with the patient, we sent her for mastectomy.\\nThe mastectomy was performed in February 2013.\\nAt the time of mastectomy, an invasive ductal carcinoma of 3.7 cm, grade III was seen.\\nDCIS was seen, 5/14 lymph nodes were positive.\\nExtensive lymphatic tumor invasion was identified.\\nThe pathologic stage was a T2 N2 Mx.\\nThis was technically a stage IIIA breast cancer but recall, she had bone metastasis at presentation, so her actual stage is a stage IV.\\nThe patient slowly recovered from her operation.\\nShe was reevaluated with scans.\\nThere is no obvious visceral disease.\\nHer bone scan showed uptake at T4 consistent with her known metastatic disease.\\nWe repeated her MUGA scan.\\nHer ejection fraction was still low at 45%.\\nAfter her operation, she met with Radiation Oncology.\\nAs this is a left-sided breast cancer and she has a pacemaker on the left\\nside, the pacemaker had to be moved to the opposite right side before radiation could be initiated.\\nUltimately after a lot of discussions about the pros and cons of radiation, she did not elect to pursue radiation.\\nAs her ejection fraction is still low, we could not give her more Herceptin.\\nBecause she is ER positive and has a lot of comorbidities, we thought the best plan of care was aromatase inhibitors.\\nWe started Arimidex.\\nShe promptly had an allergic reaction to that.\\nShe is now on Aromasin and doing considerably better.\\nShe is more active at home and when she is active, she does have pain in her thoracic spine were she suffered a compression fracture after her radiation.\\n\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, aspirin, fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B, B complex, Lutein, Avastin eye injections, ibuprofen, Prilosec and Aromasin.\\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA, CARDURA, MORPHINE, DEMEROL, SACCHARIN, POLY IRON, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, PORK, COFFEE AND

3.9, chloride 103, bicarbonate 30, BUN 21, creatinine 1.23.\\nHer bilirubin is 0.4, her ALT is 22, her AST is 25, alkaline phosphatase is 65.\\nIron is 94.\\nTIBC is 371.\\nFerritin is 131.\\nWhite count 3.6, hematocrit 34.3, platelets of 87.\\nHer last CA15-3 is 24.5.\\nHer occult blood in the stools are negative.\\n\\n\\n RADIOLOGY REVIEW:  She has not had any radiographic studies since she was last here on April 8th.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nA 77-year-old woman with a host of comorbid problems who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nThus she had stage IV breast cancer at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion.\\nShe had four cycles of \"neoadjuvant Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\"\\nIdeally we wanted to do six; however, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after four cycles, we thought we will obtain maximal benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress.\\nWe sent her for surgery.\\nEven after this course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she barely got through, she had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nPer se, this is stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she had bone metastasis at presentation, so she has stage IV breast cancer.\\nThe patient recovered from her operation.\\nHer CAT scans and bone scan showed a solitary bone metastasis to her thoracic spine.\\nI reviewed all her scans with her.\\nI thought it would be difficult to administer left chest wall radiation because of her pacemaker on that side.\\nEven if\\nit was technically feasible to remove the pacemaker to the other side, we still wonder about compromising her already challenge respiratory status and her ventricular aneurysm by radiating her chest wall.\\nShe considered the downsides of all this and elected not to have radiation.\\nIn the meantime, her counts remain marginal anyway and her ejection fraction when last checked was still low.\\nWe did not administer chest wall radiation.\\nWe did not try to give any more Herceptin.\\nInstead, she is on aromatase inhibitors.\\nShe seems to be marginally tolerating the Aromasin.\\nSo we will continue the Aromasin.\\nWe talked about further how we are going to follow her.\\nHer tumor markers are staying low.\\n She last had a CAT scan of her abdomen in March and it was negative.\\nHer bone scan just showed the solitary uptake.\\nHer PET scan was done initially in October.\\nI think this coming June when she is about six months out from that PET scan, I am going to do another PET scan.\\nI will use her tumor marker a way of assessing her disease.\\nUnfortunately, even if we would discover metastatic disease, she probably be only a marginal candidate for any other interventions other than hormones.\\nShe will need a mammogram of her remaining breast in September 2013.\\n 2.\\nBone metastases.\\nShe is here for her monthly Zometa.\\n 3.\\nCardiac issues.\\nAs above her last MUGA scan was back in March, her ejection fraction was still low.\\nWe will get a new MUGA scan in June.\\nI do not anticipate giving any more Herceptin even if it gets better.\\n 4.\\nAnemia with abnormal iron stores.\\nShe is intolerant of oral iron.\\nShe tolerated her IV iron.\\nShe thinks the IV iron helped.\\nHer Hemoccult cards came back negative.\\nI would certainly defer to her family physician if and when she should ever have a colonoscopy.\\n 5.\\nPersistently low white count, really no worse than it has been.\\nShe has not had any infections.\\nWe will follow that.\\n6.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nShe is not actively bleeding.\\nI told her she could go back on her aspirin.\\nAgain, we will continue to follow that.\\n 7.\\nBone health while on aromatase inhibitors.\\nAgain, she gets monthly Zometa for her bone metastasis.\\nI talked to her about taking calcium.\\nShe insists that she is intolerant of calcium products and they make her too constipated.\\n 8.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nShe has a port in and will flush it every month.\\n 9.\\nPeripheral edema.\\nThe patient asked me if she could stop her Lasix.\\nI was not the one who put her on Lasix in the first place, but I told her that seems reasonable and she could see how she does clinically.\\nShe does follow with Dr. Person6 for her cardiac issues.\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson36, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by:

THERAPY:  Zometa and Faslodex.\\n\\n\\n PAST THERAPY:  See note of March 12, 2014.\\n\\n\\n INTERIM HISTORY:  Virginia is a fragile 78-year-old woman with a host of comorbid medical problems including cardiac disease.\\nShe is here to discuss recent restaging studies.\\nPer my note of May 7, she recently had a CT of the chest that showed no metastatic disease.\\nA bone scan showed uptake in the left ischium where she already had radiation and uptake in the right skull base that could be consistent with bone mets.\\nTo further image her and further evaluate these equivocal findings, we did a PET scan and CT scan of the skull.\\nThis lady does not have a pacer in anymore, but she has pacer leads and evidently an MRI is not doable.\\nThe patient presents today.\\nShe does not have headaches, neurologic changes or visual changes.\\nShe continues to say her shortness of breath has been worsened as they radiated to her chest wall.\\nShe does not have chest pain.\\nShe does not notice increased palpitations.\\nShe does have bone pain elsewhere.\\nShe does not have hip pain.\\nShe does not have nausea, vomiting or hot flashes.\\n\\n\\n MEDICATIONS:  Please see med list from June 6.\\nIt has been reviewed by my staff is up-to-date and filed on the chart.\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  MULTIPLE DRUG ALLERGIES ARE ACCURATELY CHARTED ON THE UPDATED MEDICATION RECONCILIATION LIST.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\n\\n FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  See the interim history.\\nOtherwise 10-point review of\\nsystems has been performed and is negative.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows a pleasant lady in no acute distress.\\n VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, pulse 81, respirations 16, blood pressure 176/69, weight 163, sats 93% on room air.\\n HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nExtraocular movements intact.\\nSclerae anicteric.\\nNares, no lesion.\\nOropharynx, no lesion.\\n NECK:  No nodes and no JVD.\\n LUNGS:  Poor effort, but clear.\\nDiminished at the base.\\nNo wheezes, no rub.\\n HEART:  Regular, occasional premature beat.\\n BREAST:  .\\nThere is no evidence of chest wall recurrence.\\nThere are telangiectasias from her previous radiation to her chest wall.\\n ABDOMEN:  Soft, protuberant, no guarding and no rebound.\\n RECTAL AND GENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\n EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, no cyanosis, no edema, no cords, no Homans.\\n NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves intact.\\nSensory intact.\\nMotor intact.\\nGait intact.\\nSpeech is clear and coherent.\\n LYMPHATICS:  No peripheral lymphadenopathy.\\n\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  June 2, sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 108, bicarbonate 29, BUN 23, creatinine 1.19.\\nAdjusted calcium 9.3, bilirubin 0.4, ALT 24, AST 26, alkaline phosphatase 51, iron 69, iron sat 16.7, ferritin 85, B12 1184, folic acid greater than 20, haptoglobin is up to 23, white count 5.3, hematocrit 29.9, platelets 111.\\nCA 15-3 is up to 33.\\n\\n\\n RADIOGRAPHIC REVIEW:  X-ray, CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed focal abnormal activity within the right pleural base and consistent with malignancy, stable appearance of a mild to intermediate activity within the right supraclavicular region, which would favor benign.\\nNo convincing abnormal activity within the upper thoracic spine and left ischium.\\nCT of the head May 16, no bleed, no acute findings, atrophy, atherosclerosis, mixed attenuation area with cortical disruption in the inferior\\nright-sided skull corresponding to increased uptake in bone scan likely related to skeletal metastasis.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This is a fragile 78-year-old lady with significant cardiac history who initially presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine at presentation; therefore, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nHer previous therapies and all their attendant complications and side effects are well documented in my earlier notes.\\nShe was here a month ago and had restaging studies done.\\nHer CT chest, abdomen and pelvis did not show visceral met.\\nHer bone scan showed some new uptake in the right skull base that prompted the additional testing above.\\nThe additional testing confirmed that she indeed does have disease to her right skull base.\\nShe had no progressive visceral disease.\\nI again reiterated the following things that I told her on her last visit.\\n 1.\\nShe had no visceral disease.\\n 2.\\nThe bone scan, PET scan and CAT scan confirmed new metastatic disease to the skull base.\\n 3.\\nWe will continue her current hormonal regimen for now with\\nFaslodex and offer her palliative radiation to this lesion on her skull base.\\n 4.\\nWe will continue Zometa to hopefully slow the spread of skeletal related events.\\n\\n\\n This lady's blood counts remain marginal.\\nEven if we think she failed Faslodex, we have a limited therapeutic options.\\nRecalled this lady has MULTIPLE DRUG ALLERGIES.\\nShe did not tolerate Arimidex.\\nShe did not do especially well on Aromasin.\\nPer Institution pathway, she might be a candidate for tamoxifen.\\n\\n Another option would be to consider systemic management if her HER-2/neu amplified cancer.\\nHer last echocardiogram ejection fraction improved at 53.\\nWe might consider her for Kadcyla.\\nHer counts are marginal and her\\nperformance status is marginal, though for now, she will go through a course of palliative radiation to her skull base and we will reassess matters when she is done.\\n 2.\\nBone metastasis, continue Zometa.\\n 3.\\nAnemia, hematocrit is better and low haptoglobin and there may be an autoimmune component.\\nShe is on prednisone and folic acid.\\nThough this was previously discussed with her, she asked me again about why she was on prednisone.\\nWe again had a long discussion about the multifactorial nature of her anemia.\\nGreater than half an hour was spent with her discussing various matter including this one.\\nMore than half of time spent on counseling.\\n 4.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nPlatelets look better on steroids as well.\\n 5.\\nPersistently low white count.\\nHer white count is better on steroids as well.\\n 6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nWe will flushed her port every month.\\n 7.\\nCardiac status as above.\\nRecent MUGA scan showed a better ejection fraction.\\nMay be it is good enough, but if she really progresses, we can move on to another anti-HER-2 agent.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson29, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person29, MD on 06/10/2014 at 08:48 AM\\n\\n\\nD:  06/06/2014 02:59PM, DP\\nT:  06/07/2014

including cardiac disease and a pacemaker.\\nShe had 4 cycles of Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nIt was our initial expectation we do 6 cycles in the neoadjuvant setting.\\nShe presented with inflammatory breast cancer.\\nShe responded to this regimen and so far as her breast mass regressed and became smaller.\\nHer skin changes regressed.\\nUnfortunately, she has had ongoing problems with her blood counts and her most recent MUGA scan showed a decline in her ejection fraction.\\nFor these reasons, we elected to have her assessed for possible surgery after 4 cycles instead of 6.\\nShe did see Dr. Person6 and per the patient, she is scheduled to see Dr. Person50 in the upcoming days for cardiac clearance and if all goes well, she is going to have a mastectomy next week.\\nShe presents today, she is still complaining of shortness of breath.\\nShe said it has been progressively worse ever since we gave her chemotherapy.\\nShe has not had hemoptysis, purulent sputum, substernal chest pain or pleuritic chest pain.\\nIn terms of her compression fracture.\\nShe has no new bone pain.\\nShe has not noticed any palpitations.\\nHer breast looks about the same.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B, Lutein, Tylenol, Avastin eye injections, ibuprofen, and Prilosec.\\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA,

changes since I last examined it.\\nShe has had no nausea or vomiting.\\nNo dysuria, no hematuria.\\nNo excessive thirst, no polyuria, no recurrent fevers, no increased back pain, no pruritus or skin breakdown, no confusion, numbness or tingling.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows a pleasant lady in no acute distress.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, heart rate 80, respirations 16, blood

117.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nLeft-sided inflammatory breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified by FISH.\\nThe patient had 4 cycles of Taxotere,\\ncarboplatin and Herceptin.\\nShe has had to have dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia.\\nNow her MUGA scan was showing her ejection fraction dropping, which suggested we needed to hold her Herceptin.\\nThis lady initially responded to her chemotherapy, but I think her response plateaued.\\nPerhaps we got a maximum benefit from her chemotherapy.\\nI sent her to Location Surgical Group.\\nEvidently, she can now have a mastectomy because her disease did regress.\\nShe is going to see Dr. Person50 in the upcoming days and be cleared from a cardiac standpoint and have her surgery next week.\\nIf all goes well, after she recovers from her surgery, we will have to talk about other interventions.\\nBecause this was inflammatory breast cancer, she may be a candidate for radiation therapy to her chest wall.\\nHowever, her cardiac history and her pacemaker on that side may preclude that from happening.\\nShe will meet with Dr. Person17 and he can decide.\\nI will probably get another MUGA scan postoperative, if her ejection fraction comes back up, I might do more Herceptin and at some point, she will be started on hormone therapy.\\nI again explained at length to the patient and her husband that this was the option down the road.\\n2.\\nBone metastases.\\nShe had limited field radiation to T4.\\nShe is due for Zometa today.\\nWe will see her back in a month and do her next Zometa.\\n3.\\nAnemia, hematocrit looks stable.\\n4.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nPlatelets look good.\\n5.\\nCardiac issues.\\nWe will holding her Herceptin.\\nDr. Person50 is going to see her for cardiac

carboplatin and Herceptin on October 15th.\\n\\n\\n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient114 is a 77-year-old woman who was actually in the clinic today to discuss radiation therapy to her suspicious lesion on her thoracic spine.\\nWhile sitting in the Radiation Oncology waiting room, she told me that she had a \"rash\" on her leg and wanted to be seen.\\nWe put her in a room to examine her.\\nThis lady had an antecedent history of cellulitis that evidently was quite severe and she was on \"3 different antibiotics\" that she does not know the name of to clear it up.\\nWhen she saw the redness on her legs, she was concerned it might be cellulitis and wanted to be seen.\\nShe has not had any red streaks up her leg.\\nShe has not had shaking chills or rigors.\\nHer legs do feel hot and warm to her.\\nShe actually has not had a temperature at home.\\nIn terms of her underlying malignancy, she tolerated her chemotherapy reasonably well.\\nHer involved breast seems softer.\\nThere are no new lesions on her breast.\\nShe does have a rash on her upper trunk and some reddening that occurred after she got her chemotherapy.\\nShe has not had nosebleeds, gum bleeding, rectal bleeding or vaginal bleeding.\\nShe has not had cough or chest pain.\\nFor the particulars of her underlying malignancy, please see my earlier note.\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, aspirin 81 every day, PreserVision caps, omega fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B12, vitamin B complex, Lutein, Tylenol, Avastin injections in her eye, ibuprofen, Decadron premeds with chemotherapy, her Coumadin, which she was on to keep her port open has\\nbeen put on hold, Compazine, Prilosec, Ultram, nystatin and MBX.\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO MULTIPLE things, Please see old

extremities.\\nShe does not have any petechiae on her thighs or on her back, on her arms.\\nShe has a red macular rash around her neck point.\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  White count 4, hematocrit 28.6, platelets 35.\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nA rash on legs, possible cellulitis.\\nInitially, there was concern for petechiae as\\nher platelet count was low, but it does not really look like petechiae per se, maybe she does have recurrent cellulitis.\\nIt does not appear that SHE IS ALLERGIC TO CIPRO.\\nShe certainly ALLERGIC TO lot of other things INCLUDING PENICILLIN.\\nSo, I am going to give her a trial of Cipro and see how the rash trends.\\n2.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nHer platelet count is coming up.\\nShe probably has some marrow suppression from her chemotherapy.\\nI put her Coumadin 1 mg to keep her port open on hold because she was thrombocytopenic.\\nWe will\\nmonitor her CBC.\\nWhen her platelets recover, we will reinstitute chemotherapy, perhaps that will require a dose reduction with her next cycle.\\n3.\\nWorrisome lesion at T4.\\nDr. Person6 is evaluating the patient for possible radiation therapy.\\n4.\\nMouth sores better with nystatin and MBX.\\n5.\\nCardiac issues.\\nShe follows very closely with Dr. Person50.\\n6.\\nAnemia.\\nHer hematocrit is stable.\\n7.\\nPain.\\nHer Ultram seems to be working.\\n\\n So in summary, we called in the Cipro.\\nWe will get weekly CBCs and she will keep her previous appointment here.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson93, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person93, MD on 10/31/2012 at

left breast.\\nOn physical examination at that time, she had an inverted left nipple, some fullness in the central aspect of the left breast, thickening and peau d\\'orange of the skin of the left breast, and patchy erythema around the central aspect of the breast.\\nThe patient had no palpable axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.\\nThe right breast is unremarkable.\\nMrs. Patient114 underwent biopsies of the skin as well as core biopsies of the mass in the central aspect of the left breast.\\nThese were both positive for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2 positive.\\nThe patient was referred to Dr. Person36.\\nShe has undergone 4 cycles of chemotherapy with Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nSix cycles were planned, but the patient has not

metastases.\\n2.\\nAnemia.\\n3.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\n4.\\nChronically low white count.\\n5.\\nCompression fracture.\\n\\nCURRENT THERAPY:  1.\\nThe patient is on hiatus from Aromasin due to perceived intolerance.\\n2.\\nZometa for bone metastases.\\n\\nPAST THERAPY:  1.\\nFour cycles of Taxotere, carbo and Herceptin in the \"neoadjuvant setting,\" last dose of chemotherapy in January 2013.\\n2.\\nRadiation to thoracic spine.\\n3.\\nMastectomy performed in February 2013.\\n4.\\nAromasin started as single agent in April 2013.\\n5.\\nHerceptin added back in when ejection fraction improved.\\n\\nINTERIM HISTORY:  Patient114 is a complicated 78-year-old woman with a cardiac history and other medical problems.\\nShe was last here on September 25th.\\nOn physical exam, it would appear that her left mastectomy incision while well healed was starting to develop definitive evidence of dermal metastases.\\nThere were now more nodular densities tracking along the mastectomy incision.\\nThis is a woman who we did not give chest wall radiation to after her mastectomy because she had a pacemaker in on that left side.\\nThe patient told us that moving her pacemaker to the opposite side would be quite difficult and that she had to go to the Institution.\\nTherefore, since she already had stage IV breast cancer with bone mets and because of that perceived complication, we deferred on doing chest wall radiation.\\nInstead, we moved on to hormonal therapy.\\nThe patient did very poorly with Arimidex.\\nWe started her on Aromasin, which she handled marginally better.\\nWe have been following her with regular MUGA scans to adjust her ejection fraction\\nbecause of her prior Herceptin exposure.\\nHer MUGA scan transiently improved and we put her back on Herceptin.\\nUnfortunately, a MUGA scan done after she was put back on Herceptin showed a decline in her ejection fraction, so we put that on hold.\\nThe patient on her most recent visits has been complaining of headaches and a feeling of her heart pounding in her ears and anxiety, all of which she attributes to Herceptin.\\nWhen we discovered that she was developing dermal mets, we put the Herceptin on hold and we looked for other options.\\nUltimately, the patient did go to the Institution.\\nI am in receipt of notes from the patient\\'s cardiologist, Dr. Person6.\\nDr. Person6 was able to remove the pacemaker.\\nHe did not feel at this point, it needed to be reinserted.\\nThe patient has her pacemaker out and seems to be doing okay.\\nThe lesions on her chest wall look about the same.\\nThe patient set off her Aromasin and her headaches are a little better but still present and she is still quite concerned that she can hear \"her heart pounding in her ear.\"\\nShe is short of breath and tired.\\nShe has not had any overt bleeding.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, fish oil, vitamin D, levothyroxine, Lutein, vitamin B.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA, CARDURA, MORPHINE, DEMEROL, SACCHARIN, POLY-IRON, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, PORK, COFFEE.\\nSHE DID NOT TOLERATE ARIMIDEX,\\nSHE DOES NOT THINK SHE IS TOLERATING AROMASIN VERY WELL.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has not had fever.\\nShe does have fatigue.\\nShe does not have any new visual problems.\\nShe does not have blurry vision.\\nShe hears her heart pounding in her ears.\\nShe has not had a sore throat or a nosebleed.\\nShe is chronically short of breath.\\nShe does not have hemoptysis or wheezing.\\nShe does not have chest pain.\\nShe does not\\nnotice increased tachycardia.\\nShe does not have nausea, vomiting, constipation or heartburn.\\nShe does not have dysuria or urethral discharge.\\nShe does not have postmenopausal bleeding.\\nShe has back pain from her previous compression fracture.\\nThe lesions on her chest wall look about the same.\\nShe has not had abnormal balance or confusion.\\nShe still has headaches, which she says are exacerbated by Aromasin.\\nShe rates her emotional well-being as fair.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows an anxious lady.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  97.2, 77, 16, 179/84, 142, 93% on room air.\\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nNares, no discharge.\\nOropharynx, no intraoral lesion, no white plaques.\\nNECK:  No nodes, no JVD.\\nLUNGS:  Clear, nonlabored respirations.\\nBreath sounds are equal.\\nBACK:  Shows a markedly kyphotic curve.\\nNo spinal tenderness, no flank tenderness.\\nHEART:  Regular with a soft systolic murmur.\\nBREASTS:  Her right breast is pendulous without masses.\\nThe left chest wall shows evidence of dermal metastases.\\nNo skin breakdown.\\nABDOMEN:  Protuberant.\\nPositive bowel sounds.\\nRECTAL:  Deferred.\\nGENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\nEXTREMITIES:  Brawny stasis changes.\\nNo cords, no Homans.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves intact.\\nSensory intact.\\nMotor intact.\\nGait intact.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  October 14th, sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 105, bicarb 27, BUN 19, creatinine 1.06, calcium is 9.1.\\nWhite count 3.1, hematocrit 27.2, platelets of 86.\\nLast CA15-3 is 28.\\nStools for occult blood were negative back in March.\\n\\nRADIOGRAPHIC REVIEW:  Thoracic spine x-ray on September 26th, osteopenia, degenerative change, compression fracture.\\nCT chest, abdomen and pelvis on September 26, 2013, stable compression fracture at T4, stable small partially calcified density in right supraclavicular area, significant improvement in soft tissue density at the left mastectomy site, but\\nresidual soft tissue changes remain, residual malignant disease cannot be excluded, significant improvement in atelectasis, moderate cardiomegaly, cholelithiasis, minimal renal cortical scarring.\\nBone scan on September 27th, new focus of positive uptake in acetabular region on the left posterior pelvis, dilatation of the distal right ureter, persistent positive uptake in left superior posterior rib and T4.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a 78-year-old woman with a very significant cardiac history who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nThus, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion.\\nShe had four cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carbo and Herceptin that finished up by January 2013.\\nIdeally, six were planned; however, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo, after these four cycles, it was felt she probably obtained maximum benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress somewhat.\\nShe had a mastectomy in February 2013.\\nEven after a course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she could barely tolerate, she had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThe breast itself was a stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she did have that bone metastasis at presentation, so she had stage IV disease from the very beginning.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nA PET scan done postoperatively showed uptake in her thoracic spine.\\nI reviewed all her scans with her.\\nAt that point, it was felt it would be very difficult to administer chest wall radiation.\\nThe patient had a pacemaker and defibrillator on that left side.\\nEven if it were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put it on the other side, there were concerns about her already compromised and challenged\\ncardiorespiratory status.\\nShe had stage IV disease to begin with and with these concerns, we elected at that point not to do radiation.\\nIn the meantime, her counts remained marginal.\\nShe was put on Aromasin because she was ER/PR positive.\\nHer ejection fraction improved a bit.\\nWe added the Herceptin back in.\\nShe was on Herceptin and Aromasin.\\nShe certainly was not tolerating it very well.\\nHer latest MUGA scan showed a drop in her ejection fraction.\\nTherefore, for that reason alone, we had to hold the Herceptin.\\nShe continued to complain of headaches while on Aromasin.\\nA CAT scan of the head showed no brain metastases.\\nIn the midst of all these complaints about her intolerance of Aromasin, we noticed that some lesions on her chest wall which we had been observing actually got worse.\\nShe now clearly manifested dermal metastases.\\nBecause now she had overt dermal metastases, we had to address the chest wall.\\nWe sent her to Dr. Person50 and ultimately she went to the Institution.\\nIt is fortunate that Dr. Person6 was able to just remove the pacemaker and defibrillator.\\nContrary to the patient\\'s concern that she would have to go through another procedure to have the pacemaker placed on the opposite side, she actually just had the pacemaker removed.\\nShe seems to be doing fine without it.\\nDr. Person17 will see her and institute chest wall radiation.\\nI discussed the case with Dr. Person20.\\nThese clearly appear to be dermal mets.\\nI do not think we need a tissue diagnosis to confirm them.\\nWe are going to move ahead with chest wall radiation.\\nAfter she completes her chest wall radiation, we are going to have to readdress the matter with systemic management.\\nIf these chest wall lesions occurred while on Herceptin, maybe we should consider her for another HER-2 agent like perhaps Kadcyla.\\nOf course, with her shortness of breath and marginal ejection fraction, that might not be the best choice.\\nAnother option\\nmight be Faslodex.\\nShe certainly still complains that she gets headaches and does not think she can handle Aromasin.\\nAt any rate, we will give her a hiatus from both systemic medicines like Kadcyla as well as not institute the Faslodex.\\nWe will get her through her radiation therapy and go from there.\\n2.\\nBone metastases.\\nHer bone scan is as above.\\nWe will get plain films of those new areas in her acetabular area.\\nWe are going to reinstitute her Zometa.\\n3.\\nAnemia.\\nHer H and H has dropped.\\nWe are going to transfuse some blood as she has a cardiac history and is symptomatic from her shortness of breath.\\n4.\\nThrombocytopenia, a little worse.\\nContinue to follow it.\\n5.\\nPersistently low white count.\\nContinue to follow it.\\n6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nShe still has a port in.\\nWe have to still flush that every month.\\n7.\\nCardiac issues.\\nThe patient just saw Dr. Person6 in the Institution and will follow locally with Dr. Person50.\\nIt is interesting to note that in Dr. Person6\\'s impression and plan, he states that \"she is not willing to consider taking standard medical therapies for coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease.\"\\nShe states \"my body has rejected all these medicines in the past.\"\\nThus, this patient\\'s problems with toleration of therapy are not only her breast cancer medicines, but evidently her cardiac medicines as well.\\n\\nSo, in summary, continue Zometa, transfuse blood, have her undergo radiation with Dr. Person17.\\nWe will bring her back and discuss further interventions, probably Faslodex.\\nThe patient\\'s CAT scans and bone scans were reviewed.\\nA copy was given to the patient.\\nShe was given results of her labs.\\nThe rationale for Faslodex was explained to her.\\nGreater than 45 minutes were spent discussing this case with the patient and her husband.\\nMore than 50% of the time was involved in counseling her about her disease.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson33, MD\\nElectronically signed by: Person33, MD on

therefore, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion on her spine.\\nShe had 4 cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin that finished by January 2013.\\nIdeally, 6 cycles were planned; however, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after these 4 cycles, it was felt she probably obtain maximal benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress somewhat.\\nShe had a mastectomy in February 2013.\\nEven after a course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she could barely tolerate, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThe breast itself was stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she did have that bone metastasis at presentation, so she was stage IV from the very beginning.\\nShe recovered from that operation.\\nA PET scan done postoperatively showed uptake in her thoracic spine.\\nThat PET scan was done in June.\\nAt that point, it was felt that it would be difficult to administer chest wall radiation.\\nThe patient had a pacemaker and a defibrillator on that left side, so even if it was technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put it on the other side, there were concerns about her already compromised and challenged cardiorespiratory status.\\nShe had stage IV disease to begin with, and with these concerns, it was elected not to do radiation at that\\ntime.\\nIn the meantime, her counts remain marginal.\\nShe was put on Arimidex because she was ER positive, PR negative.\\nShe tolerated the Arimidex exceedingly poorly.\\nWe moved on to Aromasin.\\nThe whole time she was on Aromasin, she complained of hot flashes, emotional lability and headaches.\\nHer ejection fraction improved a bit.\\nWe added Herceptin back, so she was on Herceptin and Aromasin.\\nShe was not tolerating that very well.\\nShe thought the Herceptin made her headaches worse.\\nShe had a MUGA scan done in September that showed her ejection fraction drop.\\nTherefore, for that reason alone, we had to hold the Herceptin.\\nShe continued to complain of headaches while on Aromasin.\\nA CAT scan of her head in August showed no brain metastasis.\\nIn the midst of all these complaints about her intolerance of Aromasin, it was noticed that the lesions on her chest wall were getting worse.\\nShe was clearly manifesting dermal metastases.\\nBecause she now had overt dermal metastases, we had to address the chest wall.\\nUltimately, she went back to her cardiologist.\\nHe was able to remove the pacemaker and the defibrillator.\\nContrary to the patient\\'s concern that she has to go through another procedure to have a pacemaker placed on the opposite side, she did not.\\nShe actually just had to have a pacemaker removed.\\nShe seems to be doing fine without it.\\nShe is now getting radiation to her dermal metastases.\\nAfter she completes chest wall radiation, we have to address the matter of systemic management.\\nGiven her compromised ejection fraction, it may be hard to put her on HER-2/neu blocking agents.\\nThese chest wall lesions appear to progress while she was getting Herceptin, so maybe we have to consider another HER-2/neu agent like Kadcyla.\\nAnother option would be just the use of hormonal approach and switch her to Faslodex.\\nIdeally, she said she did not think she could handle the Aromasin because of headaches, but\\nnow she was saying her headaches are still there, but she is beginning to question if Aromasin is at the problem.\\nAt any rate, for the time being, she will finish her radiation, we will continue the Zometa and after she is done with radiation, we just talk about other systemic interventions.\\nI suppose before we have to decide anything, she may need another MUGA scan.\\nHer last MUGA scan was in October. Her tumor markers are marginally elevated and may be another useful way to monitor her response to our interventions.\\n 2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nShe is on monthly Zometa.\\n 3.\\nAnemia.\\nHematocrit stable.\\nWe are going to repeat that iron stores when she comes back the next time.\\n 4.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nPlatelets about the same.\\n 5.\\nPersistently low white count, really no change.\\n 6.\\nPoor vascular access, flush her port.\\n 7.\\nConcerns about her weight.\\nI explained her weight really has not changed all that much since she started coming here.\\nAnother option if we are really concerned about her weight may be to give her Megace, which could address her hormone positive breast cancer, but of course that comes with attended clotting risk in this woman who has a significant cardiac history.\\n\\n\\n So for now, we will administer her Zometa today.\\nWe will see her in a month with labs and tumor markers.\\nWe will entertain doing another MUGA scan and talk about systemic options.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson29, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person29, MD on 12/18/2013 at 08:48 AM\\n\\n\\nD:  12/11/2013 03:59PM, DP\\nT:  12/12/2013

haptoglobin.\\n3.\\nHistory of thrombocytopenia.\\n4.\\nChronically low white count.\\n5.\\nHistory of compression fracture.\\n\\nCURRENT THERAPY:  Zometa and Faslodex, last dose administered August 11.\\n\\nPAST THERAPY:  See note of July 7.\\n\\nINTERIM HISTORY:  Virginia is a 79-year-old woman with other comorbid problems including cardiac disease.\\nShe is here for her Zometa and Faslodex.\\nDue to some confusion with scheduling, she is a little overdue.\\nShe has had an uneventful time since she was last here.\\nShe is chronically short of breath, probably related to her cardiac issues.\\nShe has not had substernal chest pain.\\nShe does not notice any changes over her chest wall.\\nShe does not have increased bone pain, headaches, nausea, or vomiting.\\nLast month, she was told to decrease her prednisone to 10.\\nEvidently that did not happen.\\nShe is still on 20 of prednisone.\\nThe stated reason she is on prednisone is because she has a low haptoglobin level and we think her anemia is in some part related to possible hemolysis.\\nShe presents today with no other complaints.\\nHer port has not been flushed since August 11.\\n\\n MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, vitamin D, Synthroid, Lutein, ICAPS, vitamin B, prednisone 20 - now again told to cut it to 10, folic acid, eye drops, MBX, Lasix 20, and triamcinolone cream.\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO MULTIPLE SUBSTANCES.\\nPLEASE SEE THE MEDICATION RECONCILIATION LIST.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see interim history.\\nShe complains of\\nshortness of breath, and she has some dry mouth ever since she started taking the Lasix.\\nOtherwise, 10-point review of systems was performed and is negative.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows a pleasant lady with steroid facies.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, pulse 90, respirations 16, blood pressure 135/68, 150 pounds, 91% on room air.\\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nExtraocular movements intact.\\nNares, no lesion.\\nOropharynx, no obvious intraoral lesion.\\nNECK:  No nodes, no JVD.\\nBACK:  Increased kyphotic curve.\\nNo tenderness.\\nLUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds at the base.\\nHEART:  Regular with a soft systolic murmur.\\nBREASTS:  She is status post mastectomy.\\nNo changes over her chest wall.\\nStill has the same amount of telangiectasias.\\n\\nABDOMEN:  Soft, protuberant.\\nEXTREMITIES:  Trace edema.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves intact.\\nSensory intact.\\nMotor intact.\\nSKIN:  No suspicious skin lesions.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  September 29:  Creatinine is 1.37, white count 5.2, hematocrit 26.2, platelets of 139.\\nMammogram, September 15, negative.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a 79-year-old woman with significant cardiac disease.\\nShe initially presented with an inflammatory-type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to the thoracic spine at presentation.\\nTherefore, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nHer previous therapies and all their attendant complications and side effects are documented in earlier notes and summarized in my note of July 7.\\nHer restaging studies in June suggested perhaps progressive bone metastasis.\\nShe did not have any visceral metastasis.\\nBecause of her age and comorbidities and marginal blood counts, we simply radiated the new bone metastasis, which was a lesion at the base of the skull, and we left her on her same regimen.\\nShe seemed to\\nbe doing well.\\nClinically, she does not really have any new complaints.\\nShe is here today to get her Faslodex and Zometa.\\nShe is set up for formal restaging studies.\\nEvidently these are all dated October 6.\\nGiven her marginal cardiac status, we have also repeated her MUGA scan.\\nWe will look at both her MUGA scan and her restaging studies.\\nIf there is progressive disease, but her MUGA scan looks better, we might consider her for Kadcyla.\\nIf there is progressive disease and her MUGA scan looks worse, we might consider her for alternative therapy such as Megace.\\nFor now, however, she is due for Faslodex and Zometa and will get these medications today.\\n2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nNo new pain.\\nContinue Zometa.\\n3.\\nAnemia due to multiple things including low haptoglobin, including abnormal iron stores.\\nWe are going to get haptoglobin and iron stores today.\\nLast month, I told her to cut her prednisone down to 10.\\nShe did not do that.\\nI told her to cut her prednisone down to 10 today, and we will review her haptoglobin and iron stores.\\n4.\\nLow white count.\\nIt is better, but she is on steroids.\\n5.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nPlatelets are better.\\n6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nShe needs her port flushed.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson29, MD\\nInstitution at

little change.\\nThe patient said that she symptomatically has felt far more short of breath.\\nWe have been monitoring her with MUGA scan because of her prior Herceptin administration.\\nHer MUGA scan on September 24th did show a decreased ejection fraction of 43 that was down from her prior ejection fraction of 50 three months ago.\\nThe patient in addition to being short of breath continues to complain of headaches.\\nThe patient thought her headaches\\ncould be causally related to either the Herceptin or the Aromasin.\\nIn fact, her complaints of headaches were so profound that we held

left ventricular aneurysm noted.\\nHead CT on August 29th, no acute abnormality.\\nEchocardiogram from Seneca Cardiology, September 10th, left ventricular chamber size is normal with low normal systolic function.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a 78-year-old woman with a very significant cardiac history who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nThus, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to her solitary metastatic\\nlesion.\\nShe then had four cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nThis was finished up by January 2013.\\nIdeally six were planned; however, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after four cycles, it was felt she probably obtained maximal benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress.\\nShe had a mastectomy in February 2013.\\nEven after this course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she barely tolerated, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThe breast itself was a stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she did have that bone metastasis, so she was actually stage IV from the very beginning.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nA PET scan done postoperative showed uptake in her thoracic spine.\\nI reviewed all the scans with her.\\nIt was felt that it would be very difficult to administer chest wall radiation because of the pacer on that side.\\nEven if it were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put it on the other side, one would still have concerns about her already compromised and challenged cardiorespiratory status.\\nAs she had stage IV disease to begin with and with those concerns, we elected to not do radiation.\\nIn the meantime, her counts remain marginal.\\nWe put her on Aromasin.\\nHer ejection fraction improved a little bit.\\nWe then added Herceptin back in.\\nShe was on Herceptin and Aromasin.\\nShe is not tolerating it very well.\\nHer latest MUGA scan showed her ejection fraction drop.\\nTherefore, for that reason alone, we have to hold the Herceptin.\\nShe complains of headaches with the Aromasin.\\nHer CAT scan of the head shows no brain metastasis.\\nNow it looks like the lesions on her chest wall that we were watching have actually manifested as dermal metastasis.\\nI think that now clearly they are progressing.\\nHer tumor markers are rising.\\nI discussed the case informally with Dr. Person50.\\nDr.\\nPerson50 agreed to see the patient.\\nThe entire issue of if we have to move the pacer to the opposite side or do some other intervention to take care of her chest wall lesions will have to be raised.\\nSo for the current time, I will do the following:  1)\\nI will hold her Aromasin.\\n2)\\nI will hold her Herceptin.\\n3)\\nTo evaluate her shortness of breath, I am going to reevaluate her with a CAT scan.\\nI will also do another bone scan because she is having more bone pain.\\nDr. Person50 will see her and coordinate with her other providers if her pacemaker can be changed now that we have definitive evidence of dermal metastasis that might need to be radiated.\\nRecall that she did not undergo chest wall radiation initially because of concerns of moving the pacemaker and the fact that she had stage IV disease from the beginning.\\nIf indeed she cannot take Herceptin and it looks like she progressed through Aromasin, we will have to look at other systemic options.\\nOne option may very well be Faslodex.\\nI will see her back after her scans and after the possible plans for radiation are in place and we will discuss this further.\\n2.\\nBone metastases.\\nWe will do another bone scan.\\nAt some point, we will reinstitute her Zometa.\\n3.\\nCardiac issues.\\nHer echocardiogram looks the same.\\nHer MUGA shows a decrease in her ejection fraction.\\nWe will hold her Herceptin.\\n3.\\nHeadaches.\\nCAT scan looks negative.\\nWe will hold her Aromasin and see if her headaches go away off the Aromasin.\\nI think she may be progressing through Aromasin anyway.\\n4.\\nAnemia.\\nHemoglobin and hematocrit is no worse.\\n5.\\nPersistently low white count, looks stable.\\n6.\\nThrombocytopenia, looks stable.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson93, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person93, MD on 09/29/2013 at 08:55 PM\\n\\n\\nD:  09/25/2013 04:38PM, DP\\nT:  09/26/2013 04:23AM, pn\\nR:

HER-2/neu amplified by FISH with possible metastatic disease to thoracic spine.\\nThe patient is status post first cycle of Taxol and Herceptin, Taxotere and carboplatin one week ago.\\n\\n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient114 is a 77-year-old woman with a host of cardiac issues who presented with clinical inflammatory breast cancer.\\nThe particulars of her workup are well documented in earlier notes.\\nShe had her first cycle of Herceptin, Taxotere and carboplatin a week ago followed by Neulasta.\\nShe did have some aching in her bones and joints, probably from the Neulasta, but Ultram prescribed by Location Surgical Group seemed to help.\\nShe has called in numerous times to our clinic after she received this chemotherapy.\\nMost recently, she called in on the 18th saying she had some trouble swallowing.\\nWe called in some Prilosec and that seemed to help.\\nShe still has multiple issues.\\nShe wears dentures and her gums are sore, her mouth is sore.\\nShe has difficulty eating, the food does not stick as much, and she has a poor appetite.\\nWhen her family tried to give her Ensure or Boost, they made her sick at her stomach and she vomited it up.\\nShe has not had any diarrhea.\\nShe has not had any chest pain.\\nShe has not had any increased shortness of breath.\\nShe was complaining a lot of discomfort in her back and shoulders after she had to have her PET scan and keep her hands over her head, but that has not gotten any worse.\\nHer hair has not started falling out.\\nShe really has not noticed much appreciable change in her breast.\\nHer underlying history of malignancy is as follows.\\nRecently, she noticed some changes in her left nipple, she noted that it was\\ninverted and her left breast felt lumpier and flatter.\\nShe thought she initially developed \"a rash on her left breast.\"\\nShe brought this to the attention of her healthcare providers in September.\\nShe underwent a mammogram and that showed an increased density in the subareolar tissue in the outer upper quadrant of the breast.\\nDiffuse thickening was seen.\\nTwo soft tissue masses were present.\\nThe patient had an ultrasound of her breast that revealed multiple suspicious masses, a lymph node was seen in the left axilla.\\nThe patient underwent punch biopsies of her skin that showed adenocarcinoma involving the dermal lymphatics.\\nShe also had an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy that showed infiltrating ductal carcinoma, poorly differentiated, as well as DCIS.\\nER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nThe patient had a staging workup that showed activity not only in her breast, but at T4.\\nA CAT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed the left breast cancer with prominent left axillary lymph nodes.\\nA bone scan showed activity at T4.\\nIt is suspicious that she might have metastatic disease to her thoracic spine.\\nShe has got a pacemaker in, so we cannot do an MRI.\\nI did not want to put this lady through another CAT scan until she saw radiation to see how suspicious they thought this lesion was.\\nOf note, she does have some back pain.\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, aspirin, Tylenol, Avastin injections in her eye, ibuprofen, Coumadin to keep her port open, Decadron, Compazine, Prilosec, and Ultram.\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO NUMEROUS THINGS DOCUMENTED IN EARLIER NOTES.\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  No visual problems, no nosebleeds, no gum bleeding, sore lips sore gums, difficulty swallowing.\\nNo worsening of her breasts.\\nNo increased chest pain.\\nSome back pain, which

just completed a course of radiation therapy to bony mets at the base of skull.\\n\\nINTERIM HISTORY:  Patient114 is a 79-year-old woman with a host of comorbid medical problems including cardiac disease.\\nShe was last here on June 6th.\\nOn that date of service, June 6th, we reviewed her scans with her.\\nHer last formal CAT scans were performed on May 6th, CT chest and abdomen.\\nWe explained to her that she had no visceral metastatic disease by CAT scan.\\nA bone scan showed uptake in the left ischium where she already had radiation and uptake in the right skull base that was\\nconsistent with bone mets to further image her and to further evaluate those findings.\\nA PET scan was done as well as a CAT scan at the base of the skull.\\nThe last PET scan was performed in June 2dn that showed uptake at the base of the skull.\\nA CAT scan of the brain was checked that was done on May 16 and that showed mixed attenuation.\\nUptake was seen on the bone scan was felt to be related to skeletal mets, so therefore, on June 6th, an extensive discussion was held.\\nWe reiterated the following things to her.\\n\\n1.\\nShe has no visceral disease.\\n2.\\nThe bone scan, PET scan and CAT scan confirmed new metastatic disease to the skull base.\\nThe plan at that point was to continue the Faslodex, Zometa and administer palliative radiation to her skull base.\\nShe is elderly.\\nShe has cardiac problems.\\nShe has marginal blood counts.\\nWe really did not want to move on to any other hormonal regimen nor did we want to give her chemotherapy.\\nWith her marginal ejection fraction, she probably was not a good candidate for her anti-HER-2 agents.\\nHer last ejection fraction; however, by echocardiogram was somewhat improved at 53%, so we thought that if she showed overt progression, we could still consider her for an agent such as Kadcyla.\\nThis was reviewed with the patient and she agreed with the plan of care.\\nShe returns today with her husband.\\nShe tolerated the radiation well.\\nShe did develop some sore throat.\\nShe is on Magic Mouthwash.\\nShe is still having a sore throat.\\nShe seems like she perceives herself as getting more forgetful and indeed she seems to be.\\nShe has not had headaches.\\nShe is no more short of breath than she chronically is and she has not had any chest pain.\\nShe does not notice any changes in her chest wall.\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, vitamin D, levothyroxine, Lutein, vitamin B12, prednisone, folic acid, prednisolone eyedrops, Magic Mouthwash and today, we prescribed nystatin swish and swallow.\\nALLERGIES:  SHE HAS MULTIPLE DRUG ALLERGIES THAT ARE WRITTEN ON THE MEDICAL RECONCILIATION LIST.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Please see the interim history, otherwise 10 point review of systems has been performed and is negative.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows a lady in no acute distress.\\nShe is starting to develop steroid facies.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98, pulse 76, respirations 16, blood pressure 171/76, weight 151, and 93% on room air.\\nHEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nExtraocular movements intact.\\nSclerae anicteric.\\nOropharynx white patches.\\nNECK:  No nodes.\\nLUNGS:  Increased kyphotic curve, diminished breath sounds at the bases, nonlabored respirations.\\nHEART:  Regular with a systolic murmur.\\nCrisp valve tones.\\nCHEST WALL:  There are telangiectasias, no evidence of chest wall recurrence.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft, protuberant.\\nRECTAL:  Deferred.\\nGENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\nEXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, no cyanosis, and no edema.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves intact.\\nSensory intact.\\nAffect vague, but she is oriented.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  On July 7th, sodium 140, potassium 4, chloride 106, bicarbonate 28, BUN 25, creatinine 1.29, adjusted calcium 95.\\nLast haptoglobin from June 2nd was 23.\\nWhite count 5.4, hematocrit 33.3, platelets of 116.\\nHer last CA 15-3 from June 2nd was 33.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This is a 79-year-old woman who has significant cardiac disease.\\nShe initially presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine at presentation.\\nTherefore, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nHer previous therapies and all their attendant complications and side effects are documented in my earlier notes and summarized above.\\nShe recently had\\nrestaging studies.\\nThey were discussed with her last month.\\nThey were rediscussed with her this month.\\nIt was explained to her again that she had.\\n1.\\nNo visceral disease.\\n2.\\nNew bony disease to the skull base, which we have addressed with radiation.\\n\\nOur plan therefore is:  1.\\nWe will continue the same hormonal regimen for now, Faslodex.\\nWe will continue Zometa to prevent the spread of bone mets.\\nShould her disease progress again or she develops visceral disease, we will talk about other options; however, were limited because:  a.\\nHer blood counts are marginal.\\nb.\\nShe has multiple drug allergies.\\nc.\\nShe has limited cardiac output.\\nIf indeed she progresses, she might be a candidate for single agent Kadcyla, but for now, we will see how her tumor markers trend, we will see how her disease progresses and we will continue the Zometa and Faslodex.\\n2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nContinue Zometa.\\n3.\\nAnemia with low haptoglobin.\\nWe repeated her haptoglobin.\\nHer CBC looks stable.\\nShe is getting steroid complications.\\nI want to taper her down on her prednisone.\\nWe will wait and see what today\\'s haptoglobin shows.\\nWe will continue monthly labs.\\n4.\\nThrombocytopenia, platelets looked better on steroids.\\n5.\\nPersistently low white count, again better with the steroids.\\n6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nContinue monthly port flushes.\\n7.\\nThrush.\\nNystatin was called in.\\n8.\\nCardiac status.\\nRecent MUGA showed a better ejection fraction.\\nIf it stays stable and her disease shows more progression, we can move on to an anti-HER-2 agent.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson29, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person29, MD on 07/14/2014 at 05:11 PM\\n\\n\\nD:

FOR VISIT:  1.\\nLeft-sided inflammatory breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified by FISH.\\nThe patient had 4 cycles of NEOADJUVANT\\nTaxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin then , status post mastectomy on February 20th, showing a 3.7 cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade III with 5/14 lymph nodes positive, stage T2 N2 Mx.\\n 2.\\nSolitary bone metastasis, status post radiation to thoracic spine, currently on Zometa.\\n 3.\\nAnemia.\\n 4.\\nCompression fracture.\\n 5.\\nHistory of thrombocytopenia.\\n\\n\\n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient114 is a 77-year-old woman with a complicated cardiac history and a host of medical problems, who developed left-sided inflammatory breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified by FISH.\\nOn her initial workup, there appeared to be a solitary metastatic lesion on her thoracic spine.\\nShe received radiation therapy to that metastatic lesion.\\nShe has been receiving NEOADJUVANT\\nTaxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin; the last dose was administered on January 8th.\\nShe had difficulty with this regimen.\\nThere were dose delays and dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia.\\nWe carefully monitored her compromised ejection fraction with MUGA scans while she was on Herceptin and a MUGA scan did show a decrease in her ejection fraction.\\nBy January 30th, her ejection fraction went from 49 to 44.\\nThis was enough of a decline in her ejection fraction that we had to hold her Herceptin.\\nAlthough she responded to this regimen and so far as clinically her breast improved, we thought that perhaps we had received our maximum response.\\nFurthermore, her compromised blood work and compromised ejection fraction probably limited how much more systemic chemotherapy we were able to administer.\\nSo, after a long discussion with\\nthe patient, we elected to go ahead and perform a mastectomy.\\nThat mastectomy was performed on February 20th.\\nThe patient was discovered to have at the time of mastectomy an invasive ductal carcinoma, 3.7 cm, grade III.\\nDCIS was also seen.\\nThe margins were negative.\\nA 5/14 lymph nodes were positive.\\nExtensive lymphatic tumor invasion was identified.\\nThe pathologic stage was a T2 N2 Mx.\\nThe patient evidently had some postop problems with shortness of breath and on February 22nd, had to have a CTA of the chest that while showing no pulmonary emboli, did show her ventricular aneurysm, her aortic valve replacement, her atherosclerotic vascular disease, pleural effusion.\\nIn the body of the report from this intervention, the radiologist says, \"the heart appears to be further increased in size, particularly the left ventricle where there is a chronic left ventricular aneurysm.\"\\nThe patient was able to be successfully discharged from the hospital.\\nShe still has a JP drain in her chest.\\nShe still remains short of breath and tired.\\nShe has not had any problems with her pacemaker that she knows of.\\nShe has not had any increased back pain.\\nShe is concerned about some nail bed changes from her previous Taxotere.\\n\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Levoxyl, Lasix, fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B, B-complex, Avastin eye injections, ibuprofen, Ultram, and Prilosec.\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA, CARDURA, MORPHINE, DEMEROL, SACCHARIN, IRON, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, PORK, COFFEE, AND GINGER.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY:  Unchanged.\\n\\n\\n FAMILY HISTORY:  Unchanged.\\n\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has had some fatigue since she has been home.\\nNo fever, no sweats.\\nShe has not had visual problems, yellowing of her eyes or blurry vision.\\nShe has no new visual problems; her chronic problems are the same and she is going to get an Avastin injection very soon.\\nShe\\nhas not had any nasal congestion or sore throat.\\nShe is chronically short of breath.\\nShe is not coughing.\\nShe has no hemoptysis.\\nShe has not had any chest pain.\\nHer pacemaker seems to be working.\\nShe has no new palpitations.\\nShe tolerated her mastectomy.\\nHer surgical incision is healing.\\nShe has not had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation.\\nShe has not had dysuria.\\nShe has not had any abnormal bleeding.\\nShe has not had a fever.\\nShe has no increased back pain.\\nShe has not noticed any rashes or skin breakdown.\\nShe has changes in her nail beds, probably from her Taxotere.\\nShe has not had abnormal balance, confusion or numbness.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows a fragile lady with increased kyphotic curve.\\nShe is alert and oriented, in no acute distress.\\n VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97, pulse 84, respirations 14, blood pressure 171/84, weight 145 pounds, satting 96% on room air.\\n HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nNormal conjunctivae, normal hearing, moist oral mucosa.\\n NECK:  No JVD.\\n LUNGS:  Diminished breath sounds at the base.\\nIncreased kyphotic curve.\\n HEART:  Regular, occasional premature beat.\\n BREASTS:  She is status post left mastectomy.\\nThere is a healing surgical incision.\\nThere is a JP drain in her chest draining pink serous fluid.\\nHer opposite breast is pendulous.\\n ABDOMEN:  Soft.\\n RECTAL:  Deferred.\\n GENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\n EXTREMITIES:  Trace edema.\\n NEUROLOGIC:  Intact.\\n SKIN:  No lesion.\\nNail bed exam, she has some lines on her nails consistent with Taxotere exposure.\\n\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 144, potassium 3.9, chloride 107, bicarbonate 30, BUN 17, creatinine 1.05.\\nHer white count is 2.8, hematocrit 28.7, platelets of 102.\\nHer ANC is only 1.6.\\n\\n\\n RADIOGRAPHIC REVIEW:  Her CTA of the chest shows no pulmonary emboli, status post recent left mastectomy with 2 surgical drains, atherosclerotic\\nvascular disease, aortic valve replacement, left ventricular enlargement, left ventricular aneurysm, pleural effusion, postradiation changes in the paraspinal regions, increased atelectasis.\\nPathology report, left breast and axillary contents, left modified radical mastectomy, invasive ductal carcinoma grade III, 3.7 cm, DCIS.\\nMargins not involved, 5/14 lymph nodes positive.\\nExtensive lymphatic invasion, T2 N2 Mx.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nAn elderly woman with a host of comorbid medical problems, who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine that was radiated.\\nShe had 4 cycles of NEOADJUVANT\\nTaxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin.\\nIdeally, we wanted to do 6.\\nHowever, she had ongoing problems with thrombocytopenia, anemia, drop in her already compromised ejection fraction,. So, after 4 cycles of this, we thought we obtained maximal benefit and we sent her for surgery.\\nSo, even after the maximum amount of chemotherapy and Herceptin she could tolerate, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThis per say is stage IIIA disease.\\nHowever, I reminded the patient she had bone metastasis at presentation.\\nShe had a solitary bone lesion.\\nSo, technically she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nThe patient presented today to me as well as to Radiation Oncology to discuss further intervention.\\nI explained to her at length that for a tumor this big with this many lymph nodes, that chest wall and axillary radiation would be indicated.\\nHowever, the patient has a pacemaker on that side.\\nShe has a ventricular aneurysm.\\nAll these things might limit our ability to do radiation.\\nEvidently, the radiation oncologist talked to her about perhaps having her pacemaker moved from the left side to the right side and that some radiation could be given.\\nThe\\nradiation oncologist talked about the upsides and downsides of doing radiation.\\nThe patient then met with me.\\nI gave her a copy of her path report.\\nI gave her a copy of her recent CTA of the chest.\\nI again gave her clinical information about staging of breast cancer.\\nI again reminded her and her husband that she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nI told them she would have to weigh carefully the risk factors of having her pacemaker moved and then having left-sided radiation performed.\\nThis lady is elderly and fragile.\\nHer lifespan is certainly going to be impacted by her cardiac disease.\\nShe had stage IV incurable disease from presentation anyway.\\nPerhaps, in light of all these findings, it might be\\nexpedient\\nto perhaps move on and just do hormonal therapy alone.\\nI will get another MUGA scan to see if we can do more Herceptin, but that might be rather problematic.\\nCertainly, the CTA of the chest she had in the hospital, while not showing pulmonary emboli, would suggest that her heart function is not very good and her ventricular aneurysm is getting worse.\\nFurthermore, even this far out from chemotherapy, her blood counts are marginal.\\nI think in addition to the cardiac concerns and the pacemaker concerns, delivering radiation therapy might prove problematic in light of her compromised blood counts.\\nI shared her lab reports with the patient as well.\\nFor the time being, we are going to do the following:  We are going to restage her with a bone scan and CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.\\nWe will get a MUGA scan to see what her ejection fraction is doing.\\nWe will follow her CBC and see how it recovers.\\nShe is also going to discuss her cardiac issues with Dr. Person6, her cardiologist.\\nEvidently, her pacemaker insertion was quite complicated.\\nShe said because she has had so many chest procedures done that she had to go all the way to the Institution to have her pacemaker placed.\\nCertainly,\\nshe needs to consider very carefully the risks and the difficulty in having it moved to her right chest.\\nIn the meantime, however, we will wait for her counts to recover, look at some MUGA scan, await Dr. Person6\\'s input.\\n 2.\\nSolitary bone metastasis.\\nAgain, I reminded her that due to this finding, she had stage IV incurable breast cancer at presentation.\\nI reminded her she did not have that robust of a response from her chemotherapy and still had a stage IIIA breast tumor.\\nI again discussed ER positive breast cancer and hormonal management.\\nIn the short haul, however, because she had bone metastases, we are going to do her Zometa today.\\nWe will get weekly CBCs and I will see her back after her scans.\\n\\n\\n I spent greater than 25 minutes discussing this case with the patient.\\nIt was spent in counseling and reviewing her records as well as breast cancer evidence-based information.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson36,

cyanosis, no edema, no cords, no Homans.\\nNEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves intact.\\nSensory intact.\\nMotor intact.\\nGait intact.\\nSpeech is clear and coherent.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  January 6, sodium 141, potassium 4.5, chloride 106, bicarbonate 29, BUN 24, creatinine 1.23.\\nIron is 58, iron sat 14, ferritin is 76.\\nWhite count 3, hematocrit 29, platelets of 100.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a 78-year-old woman with a very significant cardiac history who presented with an inflammatory-type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nTherefore, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic\\nlesion to her spine.\\nShe had 4 cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin.\\nThat was completed by January 2013.\\nIdeally 6 cycles were planned, however, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after those 4 cycles, it was felt she probably obtain maximal benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress somewhat.\\nShe had a mastectomy in February 2013.\\nSo even after a course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she could barely tolerate, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThe breast itself was the stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she did have that bone metastasis at presentation, so she has stage IV metastatic breast cancer from the very beginning.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nUpon completion of her mastectomy, we talked about other options.\\nAt that point, it was felt that it would be difficult to administer chest wall radiation.\\nThe patient had a pacemaker and defibrillator on that left side.\\nSo even if it were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put it on the other side, there were concerns about radiation therapy to her left side with her already compromised and challenged cardiorespiratory status.\\nShe had stage IV disease to begin with anyway.\\nSo with these concerns, it was elected not to do chest wall radiation at that time.\\nIn the meantime, her counts remain marginal.\\nShe was put on Arimidex because she was ER positive, PR negative.\\nHer ejection fraction was marginal and declining , so we held further Herceptin.\\nShe tolerated the Arimidex exceedingly poorly.\\nWe moved on to Aromasin.\\nThe whole time she was on Aromasin, she complained of hot flashes, emotional lability, and headaches.\\nHer ejection fraction improved a bit.\\nWe added the Herceptin back.\\nShe had about 3 doses of Herceptin.\\nSo for a while she was on Herceptin and Aromasin.\\nShe was not tolerating that very well at\\nall.\\nShe complained of headaches and weakness.\\nShe had a MUGA scan in September 2013 that showed her ejection fraction drop.\\nTherefore, for that reason alone, we held the Herceptin.\\nShe continued to complain of headaches while on Aromasin.\\nA CAT scan of head in August showed no brain mets.\\nIn the midst of all these complaints about her intolerance of Aromasin and having to put her Herceptin on hold because of compromised ejection fraction, it was noticed that the lesions on her chest wall were getting worse.\\nShe was now clearly manifesting dermal metastasis.\\nBecause she now had overt progressive dermal metastasis, we have to address the chest wall.\\nUltimately, she went back to her cardiologist.\\nHe was able to remove the pacemaker and a defibrillator.\\nContrary to the patient\\'s concern that she had to go through another procedure to have a pacemaker placed on the opposite side, she did not have to do that.\\nShe actually just had to have the pacemaker removed.\\nShe is now without a pacemaker.\\nShe completed her radiation therapy.\\nShe is now having some skin consequences as a result of that.\\nDr. Person6 will refer her to Institution.\\nI again talked to her husband and her at length regarding management of her systemic disease.\\nIf we really believe that her dermal metastasis progressed while on Herceptin, we probably need to move on to a second agent like Kadcyla.\\nUnfortunately Kadcyla can also compromise ones ejection fraction.\\nAnother option would be to use hormonal approach and switch her to Faslodex.\\nThe patient really was not handling the Aromasin very well.\\nFurthermore, if we believe the dermal metastasis progressed while on Aromasin, the Aromasin probably was not very efficacious anyway.\\nWe discussed the rationale for using Faslodex.\\nUltimately, we decided to do the following:  a.\\nWe are going to repeat her MUGA scan.\\nIf her ejection fraction looks\\nbetter or adequate, we might challenge her with Kadcyla.\\nb.\\nIn the event that her ejection fraction remains as poor as we think it is going to be, she probably would not be a candidate for HER-2/neu blocking agents.\\nTherefore, we will have to take a hormonal approach.\\nWhile we are waiting for her chest wall to heal and while we are waiting for the MUGA scan, we are going to try her on Faslodex.\\nWe will see how she handles with Faslodex.\\nThe rationale for this was explained to the patient.\\nThe patient consented to the Faslodex.\\nWe will bring her back and we will do Faslodex.\\nThe patient has not had restaging studies in a while.\\nWhile she is healing up from her chest radiation and while she is having a MUGA scan, we will restage her.\\nWe will do a bone scan and a CAT scan.\\nWe will review all these when she comes back.\\nWe are following her with tumor markers as well.\\nThey are not especially helpful as they are not very high.\\n2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nShe is going to get Zometa.\\n3.\\nAnemia.\\nHematocrit stable and iron stores adequate.\\n4.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nPlatelets are reasonably good for her.\\n5.\\nPersistently low white count. stable.\\n6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nShe gets Zometa every month, so we will flush her port every month.\\n\\nGreater than 45 minutes were spent with the patient and her husband discussing her case.\\nMore than 50% of the time was spent in counseling.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson36, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person36, MD on 01/12/2014 at 07:10 PM\\n\\n\\nD:  01/08/2014 04:07PM, DP\\nT:  01/09/2014 01:47AM,

BUN 15 and creatinine 1.05.\\nWhite count is 3.7, hematocrit is 32.3 and platelets are 106.\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nLeft-sided inflammatory breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative and HER-2/neu amplified by FISH.\\nThe patient is status post two cycles of Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin, the last of which was administered on November 5th.\\nShe has had ongoing issues with thrombocytopenia.\\nHer platelet count is finally over 100,000.\\nWe wrote for her chemotherapy at another dose reduction.\\nIn other words, her doses have been reduced twice.\\nWe will proceed ahead with chemotherapy today followed by Neulasta.\\nWe will get weekly CBCs.\\nIf all goes as planned, our expected plan of care is to administer six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then consider her for further interventions.\\n2.\\nBone metastases.\\nShe is status post limited-field radiation to T4.\\nWe have her on Zometa.\\nWe are going to continue the Zometa.\\nShe did have that compression fracture.\\nBecause of significant amount of pain, we sent her for kyphoplasty.\\nFortunately, her pain improved markedly and per Dr. Person6, we are holding off on that for now.\\nIn summary, she does not need to take her oxycodone.\\nShe will take Ultram p.r.n.\\n3.\\nAnemia.\\nHer hematocrit looks reasonably good.\\nWe will follow that again.\\nWe dose reduced her chemotherapy.\\nSo in summary, chemo today, Neulasta tomorrow and weekly CBCs.\\nShe will be back here in three weeks for her next cycle of chemotherapy and more Zometa.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson36, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person36, MD on 12/19/2012 at 03:46 AM\\n\\n\\nD:  12/17/2012 04:39PM, DP\\nT:  12/18/2012 08:31AM, pn\\nR:

3.\\nAnemia.\\n 4.\\nAbnormal iron stores.\\n 5.\\nCompression fracture.\\n 6.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\n 7.\\nLow white count.\\n\\n\\n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient114 is a 77-year-old woman with a complicated cardiac history and a host of medical problems who was here last on March 21st to discuss recent restaging studies that she had.\\nHer underlying history of malignancy will be given below.\\nBasically, she is here to discuss further systemic interventions.\\nAs we discussed with her on numerous occasions, she would be a candidate for radiation therapy to her left chest.\\nHowever, she has a left-sided pacemaker that would have to be moved to the right side.\\nShe has a MUGA scan that shows her ejection fraction dropped after we gave her Herceptin.\\nThat limits our options to give further Herceptin.\\nShe is here to follow her white count and blood count and platelet count, which is still low, even though she last had chemotherapy back in January.\\nGiven the limitations in our ability to treat her, we thought we would treat her with hormone therapy.\\nOn March 21st, we wrote a prescription for Arimidex.\\nThe patient took Arimidex one time.\\nSeveral hours later, she said she was exceedingly dizzy \"did not have control of her arms and legs\".\\nShe said we instructed her not to take any further Arimidex as she thought these complaints were causally related to the Arimidex.\\nShe had a milder bout of these sort of complaints a couple of days after taking Arimidex and none since.\\nShe remains chronically unsteady on her feet.\\nShe is a woman who had a CAT\\nscan of her brain in the fall that showed no metastatic disease.\\nBecause of her pacemaker, she is evidently unable to have an MRI of her head.\\nThose neurologic symptoms are back to their baseline.\\nShe remains chronically short of breath.\\nShe has not had any chest pain or palpitations.\\nHer underlying history of malignancy is as follows:  She developed left-sided inflammatory breast cancer.\\nShe underwent a biopsy in September 2012, that confirmed breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nOn her initial workup, there was a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nShe received radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion.\\nShe received neoadjuvant Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nLast dose was administered January 8th, 2013.\\nShe had difficulty with this regimen.\\nThere were dose delays and dose reductions due to thrombocytopenia.\\nWe carefully monitored her already compromised ejection fraction by MUGA scan while she was on Herceptin.\\nHer MUGA scan showed decrease in her ejection fraction.\\nBy January 30th, her ejection fraction went from 49-44 that was enough of a decline in her ejection fraction that we could give no further Herceptin, although she responded to this regimen in so far as clinically her breast exam removed, we thought perhaps we had achieved our maximum response.\\nFurthermore, her compromised blood work and compromised ejection fraction probably limited how much more systemic therapy we would be able to administer anyway.\\nSo after a long discussion with the patient, she was sent for mastectomy.\\nThe mastectomy was performed February 20th.\\nAt the time of mastectomy, an invasive ductal carcinoma, 3.7 cm, grade III was seen.\\nDCIS was seen.\\nMargins were negative.\\nFive of 14 lymph nodes were positive.\\nExtensive lymphatic tumor invasion was identified.\\nThe pathologic stage was a T2 N2\\nMx.\\nThe patient had some problems with shortness of breath postop.\\nA CTA of the chest showed no pulmonary emboli, but it did show her known ventricular aneurysm, her aortic valve replacement, and a pleural effusion.\\nThe patient was discharged from the hospital, she was restaged.\\nHer bone scan showed uptake at T4 consistent with her known metastatic disease.\\nA CAT scan of the abdomen showed her mastectomy, cardiomegaly, scarring at the lung bases.\\nA CT of the pelvis, no acute process.\\nHer MUGA scan again showed an ejection fraction of 45%, which was similar to her prior MUGA scan.\\n\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  She is on Levoxyl, Lasix, fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B, B complex, Lutein, Tylenol, Avastin eye drops, ibuprofen, Ultram, and Prilosec.\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN, SULFA, CARDURA, MORPHINE, DEMEROL, SACCHARIN, POLY-IRON, PLAVIX, FLAGYL, PORK, COFFEE, GINGER AND EVIDENTLY DID NOT DO VERY WELL WITH ARIMIDEX.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\n\\n FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and unchanged.\\n\\n\\n REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She does not have fever or chills.\\nShe does have some fatigue.\\nShe does not have visual problems, blurry vision or double vision.\\nShe does not have nasal congestion or sore throat.\\nShe remains chronically short of breath.\\nShe has not had hemoptysis or wheezing.\\nShe does not have chest pain, palpitations or syncope.\\nShe does not have any problems with her mastectomy incision.\\nShe has not had nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.\\nShe does not have dysuria.\\nShe does not have any swollen glands.\\nShe has not been excessively thirsty.\\nShe has not had a fever.\\nShe does not have increased back pain.\\nShe has not noticed any rashes, abrasions or skin breakdown.\\nCurrently, she has no abnormal balance, confusion, or numbness, although she feels unsteady on her feet at times, that has been present since November when she last had a head CT.\\nShe was\\nextremely dizzy a few hours after taking one Arimidex capsule.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Shows a lady who looks comfortable.\\nShe is alert and oriented in no acute distress\\n VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.2, pulse 69, respirations 16, blood pressure 154/77, 143 pounds, 95% on room air.\\n HEENT:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nOropharynx, no lesion.\\n NECK:  No nodes.\\n LUNGS:  Increased kyphotic curve, diminished breath sounds at the base.\\n HEART:  Distant and regular.\\n BREAST:  She is status post mastectomy, well-healed incision.\\nOther breast, no obvious lesions.\\n ABDOMEN:  Soft, positive bowel sounds.\\n GENITOURINARY:  Deferred.\\n MUSCULOSKELETAL:  Trace edema.\\n SKIN:  No lesion.\\n NEUROLOGIC:  Normal sensory, normal motor.\\nNo focal deficits.\\n\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 30, BUN is 20, creatinine 1.26.\\nHer adjusted calcium is 9.7, her white count is 2.8, hematocrit 32.8, and platelets are 110.\\n\\n\\n IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nElderly 77-year-old woman with a host of comorbid medical problems who presented with inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine that was radiated.\\nShe had four cycles of adjuvant Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin.\\nIdeally, we wanted to do six.\\nHowever, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after four cycles, we thought we obtained of maximal benefit.\\nWe sent her for surgery.\\nEven after this course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nPer se, this was stage IIIA disease.\\nHowever, she had a bone metastasis at presentation, so technically she was stage IV disease at presentation.\\nI had a long talk with the patient on March 21st.\\nI\\nreviewed all her scans with her.\\nI thought that it would be difficult to administer left chest wall radiation because of her pacemaker on that side.\\nEven if it were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker to the other side, we would still have to wonder about compromising her already challenged respiratory status and her ventricular aneurysm by radiating her chest.\\nShe was still considering the downside and upside consequence of this and was going to discuss it with her cardiologist.\\nIn the meantime, her counts remain low.\\nHer ejection fraction still is low.\\nWe therefore could not administer any further Herceptin.\\nI started her on Arimidex.\\nShe promptly had a reaction to it and stopped it.\\nShe is here today.\\nShe feels better.\\nWe are going to try an alternative aromatase inhibitor, namely Aromasin.\\nHopefully, she will tolerate that better.\\nWe will see how she responds to that.\\n 2.\\nBone mets.\\nShe is due for her monthly Zometa today.\\n 3.\\nAnemia with abnormal iron stores.\\nHer H and H looks better.\\nShe is intolerant of oral iron.\\nShe tolerated the IV iron.\\nWe will follow her iron stores.\\nIt looks like her Hemoccult cards are negative.\\nI will defer to her family physician, if and when she should ever have a colonoscopy.\\n 4.\\nPersistently low white count.\\nWe will follow it.\\nAgain, she probably is not going to be a good candidate for systemic chemotherapy nor radiation given that her counts are already so compromised.\\n\\nSo, Zometa today.\\nBack in a month to review her labs.\\nI also told the patient she could resume her aspirin, which was evidently stopped in the period she was having her operation.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson29, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person29, MD on 04/09/2013 at 01:24 PM\\n\\n\\nD:  04/08/2013 01:15PM, DP\\nT:  04/09/2013 02:25AM,

showed demineralized structures and a severe compression fracture of upper thoracic spine.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a 79-year-old woman with significant cardiac disease.\\nShe initially presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine at presentation; therefore, she had stage IV disease at presentation.\\nHer previous therapies and all their attendant complications and side effects are documented in earlier notes and summarized in my note of July 7th.\\nHer restaging studies in June suggested perhaps progressive bone metastases.\\nShe did not have any visceral metastases.\\nBecause of her age, her comorbidities, and marginal blood counts, we simply radiated the new bone metastases and left her on the same regimen.\\nShe seems to be doing well this month.\\nWe are going to continue her Zometa and Faslodex.\\nShe will be due for a mammogram of her remaining breast in September.\\nIn October when she is 6 months out from\\nher MUGA scan and 4 months out from her latest restaging studies, we will reevaluate her with a MUGA scan, CAT scan, and bone scan; and we will go from there.\\nIf there is progressive disease, but her MUGA scan looks good, we might consider her for Kadcyla.\\nIf there is progressive disease and her MUGA scan looks worse, we might consider her for alternative hormone therapy such as Megace.\\nFor now; however, she is due for Faslodex and Zometa.\\n2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nContinue Zometa.\\n3.\\nAnemia.\\nHaptoglobin is looking better.\\nWe will cut her prednisone back to 10 a day.\\nShe will continue her folic acid.\\nWe will recheck her iron stores next month.\\n4.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nPlatelets look good, but of course she is on steroids.\\n5.\\nLow white count better with steroids.\\n6.\\nPoor vascular access, flush her port monthly.\\n\\nGreater than half an hour was spent with the patient and her daughter, more than 50% of time was spent on counseling.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson29, MD\\nInstitution at

28, alkaline phosphatase is 66.\\nWhite count 3.3, hematocrit 31.3, platelets of 102.\\nHer last CA 15-3 is 33.\\n\\nRADIOGRAPHIC REVIEW:  CT of the head, no acute abnormality.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nThis is a now 78-year-old woman with a significant cardiac history who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nThus, she had stage IV breast cancer at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion.\\nShe had 4 cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin.\\nThis finished up by January 2013.\\nIdeally, 6 were planned; however, she had ongoing problems with anemia and thrombocytopenia and a drop in her already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after 4 cycles, it was felt she had obtained maximal benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress.\\nShe had a mastectomy in February 2013.\\nEven after this course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she barely tolerated,\\n she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThe breast itself was the stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she did have that bone metastasis, so she was actually stage IV.\\nShe recovered from her operation.\\nHer PET scan done postop showed uptake in her thoracic spine.\\nI reviewed all the scans with her.\\nWe felt it would be difficult to administer chest wall radiation because of the pacer on that side.\\nEven if it were technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put in on the right side, one would still have concerns about her already\\ncompromised and challenged cardiorespiratory status, so we elected not to do radiation.\\nIn the meantime, her counts were marginal and her ejection fraction was low.\\nWe did not plan any further chemotherapy.\\nWe put her on Aromasin.\\nShe tolerated that reasonably well.\\nWe repeated her ejection fraction and her MUGA scans improved.\\nWe tried to reinstitute Herceptin.\\nOur plan was to do 11 cycles of Herceptin as long as her MUGA scan will hold up.\\nShe has had ongoing issues with headaches and she thinks she is more short of breath.\\nTherefore, we are going to hold her Herceptin.\\nShe is scheduled for a MUGA scan in the upcoming weeks.\\nWe will look at her MUGA scan.\\nIf her MUGA scan shows an adequate ejection fraction, we will have to address her adverse side effects with headaches.\\nIf her MUGA scan shows a declining ejection fraction, we will simply continue with Aromasin alone.\\nHer rising tumor markers are somewhat concerning likewise the lesions on her chest wall also merit\\nclose watch.\\nIf they change, we have to be concerned about a chest wall recurrence and then the whole issue of radiation will have to be addressed.\\nFor now, she will just get her Zometa, no Herceptin.\\nShe did not\\nneed her Aromasin renewed.\\nWe will see her back in 3 weeks after her MUGA scan and we will follow her physical findings and tumor markers and decide when\\nwe want to do her next scan.\\n2.\\nBone metastasis due for Zometa.\\n3.\\nCardiac issues as above, MUGA is in September.\\n4.\\nHeadaches.\\nThe patient thinks they are causally related to her Herceptin, so we held the Herceptin.\\nHer CT of the head looks negative, perhaps we have to consider Dr. Person6 count result.\\n5.\\nAnemia.\\nH and H is stable.\\n6.\\nPersistently low white count, looks stable.\\n7.\\nThrombocytopenia, looks stable.\\n8.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nHer port appears to be working.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson36, MD\\nElectronically signed by: Person36, MD on 09/08/2013 at 09:56 PM\\n\\n\\nD:  09/04/2013 05:03PM, DP\\nT:  09/05/2013 01:16PM, in\\nR:

disease at presentation.\\nHer previous therapies and\\nall their\\nattendant\\ncomplications were well documented in my earlier notes.\\nShe is here to discuss her restaging studies.\\nI gave her a copy of her restaging studies:  I reviewed the actual films with the patient and her husband on the computer.\\nI told her the following:  1.\\nShe has no visceral disease.\\n\\n2.\\nThe bone scan raised the possibility of new metastatic disease to the skull base.\\nI told the patient we would get a plain film of her skull, attention skull base, .\\nIf we believe she is progressing in bone and has new metastatic disease to bone, we have several options:  1.\\nWe could continue her same hormonal regimen, namely Faslodex and offer palliative radiation to this lesion on her skull base if it is real.\\n\\n2.\\nWe could move on to another hormonal regimen.\\nRecall, this lady has multiple drug allergies.\\nRecall, this lady tolerated her Arimidex horribly.\\nPer Institution pathway, she might be a candidate for tamoxifen.\\nThat would be one option if we really indeed feel she is progressing at non-visceral sites.\\nAnother option would be to consider systemic management of HER-2/neu amplified breast cancer.\\nFortunately, her last echocardiogram showed an increased ejection fraction of 53.\\nWe might consider her for Kadcyla.\\nAt any rate, we will go ahead with the Faslodex today.\\nWe will look at that\\nplain films of the skull base.\\nWe will share those with Dr. Person6 to get his input and then we will decide on what interventions we want to change to after that is done.\\n2.\\nBone metastasis.\\nCompleted radiation.\\nContinue Zometa as above.\\nBone scan shows new uptake at the base of the skull.\\n3.\\nAnemia.\\nHer hematocrit is better.\\nShe does have low haptoglobin.\\nPerhaps there is an autoimmune component.\\nWe did put her on prednisone and folic acid.\\nShe seems to be doing better.\\nWe are going to leave her on those agents.\\n4.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nHer platelets got better with the steroids as well.\\n5.\\nPersistently low white count.\\nHer white count is marginally better on the steroids as well.\\n6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nWe flush her port every month.\\n7.\\nCardiac status.\\nHer MUGA scan looks better as above.\\nIf she is really progressing and we want to treat her with anti-HER-2/neu agent maybe that gives us some flexibility.\\n8.\\nShortness of breath.\\nHer CT scan certainly shows no metastatic disease of the lung.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson36, MD\\n\\nElectronically

abnormal bone scan of lateral and inferior pubic ramus.\\nFemur x-ray, no acute disease.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:\\n1.\\nThis is a 78-year-old woman with a very significant cardiac history who presented with an inflammatory type left-sided breast cancer, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu amplified.\\nShe had a solitary metastatic lesion to her thoracic spine.\\nShe has stage IV disease at presentation.\\nShe had radiation therapy to that solitary metastatic lesion.\\nShe had 4 cycles of \"neoadjuvant\" Taxotere, carboplatin and Herceptin that finished up by January 2013.\\nIdeally 6 were planned; however, she had ongoing problems with anemia, thrombocytopenia and a drop in already compromised ejection fraction.\\nSo after these four cycles, it was felt, she probably will obtain maximum benefit.\\nHer breast lesion did regress somewhat.\\nShe had a mastectomy in February 2013.\\nEven after a course of chemotherapy and Herceptin, which she could barely tolerate, she still had a T2 N2 lesion.\\nThe breast itself was a stage IIIA breast cancer; however, she did have that bone metastasis at presentation, so she has stage IV disease from the very beginning.\\nShe recovered from that operation.\\nA PET scan done postoperatively showed uptake in her thoracic spine.\\nThat PET scan was done in June.\\nAt that time, I reviewed all her scans with her.\\nAt that point, it was felt that it would be difficult to administer chest wall radiation.\\nThe patient had a pacemaker and defibrillator on that side, so even if it was technically feasible to remove the pacemaker and put it on the other side, there were concerns about her already compromised and challenged cardiorespiratory status.\\nShe had stage IV disease to begin with, and with these concerns, we elected at that point not to do radiation.\\nIn the meantime, her counts remained marginal.\\nShe was put on Arimidex because she was ER positive, PR negative.\\nShe tolerated the Arimidex extremely poorly.\\nWe moved on to Aromasin.\\nThe whole time she was on Aromasin, she complained of hot flashes, emotional\\nlability and headaches.\\nHer ejection fraction improved a bit.\\nWe added the Herceptin back and she was on Herceptin and Aromasin.\\nShe was not tolerating it very well.\\nShe thought the Herceptin made the headaches, she was already having from the Aromasin, worse.\\nShe had a MUGA scan done in September that showed her ejection fraction dropped.\\nTherefore, for that reason alone, we had to hold the Herceptin.\\nShe continued to complain of headaches while on Aromasin.\\nA CAT scan of her head in August showed no brain metastasis.\\nIn the midst of all these complaints about her intolerance from the Aromasin, we noticed some lesions on her chest wall that we were observing got worse.\\nShe now clearly manifests in dermal mets. Because she now had overt dermal mets we had to address to chest wall.\\nWe sent her to Dr. Person50 and ultimately she went to the Institution.\\nIt was fortunate that Dr. Person17 was able to remove the pacemaker and defibrillator, contrary to the patient\\'s concern that she will have to go through another procedure to have the pacemaker placed on the opposite side.\\nShe actually just had the pacemaker removed.\\nShe seems to be doing fine without it.\\nShe is now getting set up to have radiation therapy to her dermal mets.\\nAfter she completes the chest wall radiation, we are going to have to address the matter in systemic management.\\nGiven her compromised ejection fraction, it may be hard to put her on HER-2 blocking agents.\\nThese chest wall lesions seemed to progress while she was getting Herceptin, so maybe we need to consider her for another HER-2 agent like Kadcyla.\\nAnother option would be just to use hormonal approach and switch her to Faslodex.\\nInitially, she had said she did not think she could handle the Aromasin because of headaches, but now she is saying her headaches are still there and is beginning to question if the Aromasin was the problem.\\nAt any rate for the time being, she is\\nset up to get radiation, we will continue the Zometa and we will entertain other systemic options after she completes radiation.\\n2.\\nBone metastases.\\nWe got plain films of those new areas on bone scan, the results were given to the patient.\\nShe was given a formal copy of her bone scan and her x-rays.\\nI did discuss the case informally with Dr. Person20.\\nDr. Person20 does not want to radiate the pubic ramus because she is asymptomatic.\\nSo for now, Zometa monthly.\\n3.\\nAnemia.\\nWe transfused blood.\\nA couple of days later, she was in the hospital with CHF.\\nHer hematocrit is better and the CHF was treated.\\nWe will continue to see how her hematocrit trends, but obviously be very cautious in transfusing blood.\\n4.\\nThrombocytopenia.\\nHer platelets are about the same.\\n5.\\nPersistently low white count, really no real change.\\n6.\\nPoor vascular access.\\nShe has a port in, we will flush it every month.\\n7. Cardiac issues.\\nPer the discharge summary, her echocardiogram does not look any different from the one she had in the Institution.\\nAgain, the patient\\'s case was discussed extensively with the patient and her husband.\\nShe was given copies of her scan.\\nShe was reminded that she was educated about Faslodex the last time she was in.\\nWe also reviewed tumor markers with the patient.\\nWe said despite progressive disease, her CA 15-3 is not going up, and that may not be a useful way to follow her disease.\\n\\nGreater than half an hour was spent discussing the case with the patient and her husband, more than 50% of the time was involved with counseling her about her disease.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson33, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person33, MD on

She has had no history of this in the past.  Only went\\nthrough something like this closely when her father died many years ago.  She\\nstates that she had thought she felt something in her left breast, an\\nultrasound was ordered, nothing was seen, but yet this still continued, and now\\nin the past week or so has resolved.  She feels back to her baseline.  During\\nthe entire period of her cancer recovery, with the surgery, changing doctors,\\nbeing on chemotherapy, she pretty much had been very stoic and now that she has\\nbeen off the chemotherapy and been pretty much on her own this may very well be\\nsomewhat of a posttreatment and post medical surveillance type of reaction.  No\\nsuicidal thoughts.  Very functional.  No nausea or vomiting.  No constitutional\\nor somatic symptoms.  Also, noticing some pain in her lower neck, stiffness,\\ntension up across the upper back and she has had this in the past.  No numbness\\nor tingling.  Denies any injury and just some tension type headache.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE:\\nWeight 143, 98.9, pulse 68, 100/60.  She is alert and oriented, quite tearful,\\nopenly discussing how she felt, the fact she feels better now and almost did\\nnot come, but promised her surgeon, and family that she would be here.  She is\\nscheduled for some further reconstructive surgery on her right breast.  This is\\nreally not giving her any anxiety.  We did talk for some time.  She did seem to\\nbe quite relieved and said that she would watch and see how she does.  If she\\nhas any recurrence, she would let us know.  She also had C1 through C4 lesions\\nwith side bending restricted to the left.  C1 and C2 on the right with\\nrestriction of rotation to the right.  No grip strength weakness, reflex\\nchange, or sensory loss noted in the upper extremities.\\n\\nASSESSMENT:\\nBrief anxiety episode.\\nCervical strain/sprain.\\nSomatic dysfunction.\\nBreast cancer survivor.\\nPost mastectomy.\\n\\nPLAN:  OMT x1 region.

She literally has problems remembering that she should cook dinner or things like that.\\nHer husband is a kind of taking over the cooking.\\n\\nPAST HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.\\n\\nBLOOD WORK:  Reviewed.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Pulse 80, blood pressure 118/68.\\nWeight 104 pounds.\\nGENERAL:  Well-appearing woman, in no respiratory distress.\\nCARDIAC:  Regular without murmurs.\\nNECK:  She has a left-sided carotid bruit.\\nLUNGS:  Clear without crackles or wheezes.\\nAir movement is good.\\nABDOMEN:  Benign.\\nEXTREMITIES:  No edema.\\nBREASTS:  The right breast has a significant amount of radiation burns.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  1. Memory loss.\\nWe will do a Mini-Mental in the office today, and also like to get her set up for CT scan of the brain.\\nThis has been a long-standing thing and I talked to them about the possibilities, which\\ninclude depression and anxiety, dementia, prior strokes, thyroid disease.\\nShe has had blood work within the past few months checking thyroid, checking blood count.\\nShe has not had a head CT, so we will get that scheduled and I will schedule an appointment for her to come back, so we can review that and review mini-mental and decide about the next step.\\n 2. Carotid bruit.\\nThis is a new finding.\\nOn looking back at my notes over the past year, I do not have a documented exam with a carotid bruit, so needs workup and will start with carotid Dopplers.\\n 3. Hypertension.\\nVery good control.\\n 4. Breast cancer.\\nAs above, she is getting close to finishing her radiation treatment.\\nThen the after that is going to be to start her on Arimidex.\\nIf fact, she has already filled the prescription, but she is waiting to start until she follows up with Oncology after her treatments are done.\\n 5. We will get her scheduled for the CT scan of the brain, the carotid Dopplers, and do the Mini-Mental today and then, I will see her back in the office afterwards to review them.\\nGiven her history of uncontrolled hypertension as well as the carotid bruit, I certainly have to be concerned about prior stroke giving her memory loss and I talked to her about that today, but again, we will await further workup.\\n\\n\\n\\n _________________________\\n\\nPerson2, MD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n D: 04/11/2012 08:59 AM (EST)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT: 04/11/2012 04:15 PM (EST)\\nDJN: \\nSJN:

OncoDX score is 19.\\nHer risk of recurrence was 12%.\\nShe was on the low end of the intermediate range.\\nGiven her age and her smoking history, we thought she would be best served by taking hormone therapy alone.\\nTherefore, she did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nShe had radiation therapy to her breast.\\nThe radiation was done by April 20, 2012.\\nAfter that, we started her on Arimidex.\\nShe tolerates the Arimidex reasonably well.\\nShe has no complaints related to bone pain.\\nThe patient notes some chronic discomfort in her right breast, but that is nothing new.\\nShe did have a mammogram performed in July that shows post radiation changes.\\nHer other issue is a lymph node from the axilla that was negative for carcinoma, but did show \"lymphoid hyperplasia.\"\\nA malignant lymphoma was not identified; however, there was a \"skewed\" kappa to lambda ratio.\\nThis lady in the past was worked up for a lymphoproliferative disorder.\\nShe did have an immunoelectrophoresis that showed a small band of IgM lambda.\\nShe really\\nhad not had bone pain, renal failure nor anemia to suggest an overt plasma cell disorder, so we thought watchful waiting was all that was in order.\\nThe patient presents today.\\nShe has evidently been having problems with forgetfulness and not quite taking her meds appropriately.\\nShe did have a head CT in August and that showed a small aneurysm and ischemic changes.\\nPer the patient\\'s family, she is being followed by a doctor in Location for this aneurysm.\\nThe patient is on medications for her possible

evidence of bleed, left middle cerebral artery aneurysm.\\nChest x-ray, August 16th, COPD.\\nMammogram, July 16, short interval followup in six months, postsurgical changes in the right breast.\\nDEXA scan June 18, 2012, showed high fracture risk osteoporosis.\\nShe has a T-score that is -2.9.\\n\\nIMPRESSION AND PLAN:  1.\\nNearly 70-year-old smoker who underwent a lumpectomy and sentinel node study for a stag I T1 N0 M0 well-differentiated ductal carcinoma of the breast, ER/PR positive, HER-2/neu negative, OncoDX score was 19.\\nHer risk of recurrence was calculated to be 12%.\\nShe was on the low end of the intermediate range.\\nGiven her advanced age and frailty, we elected to start her on Arimidex.\\nShe is handling the Arimidex well.\\nShe clinically appears to have no evidence of recurrent breast cancer.\\nWe will set her up for that mammogram for six-month interval, which will take us to January.\\nWe will continue the Arimidex for five years that will take us to April 2017.\\n2.\\nBone health.\\nShe finally had a DEXA scan.\\nShe has a very low T-score.\\nShe does smoke.\\nFurthermore, she is on aromatase inhibitors, which could make her risk of osteoporosis even higher.\\nWe encouraged her to stop smoking.\\nShe is on calcium and we qualified her for Reclast, so she will get Reclast today and then get yearly.\\n3.\\nLymph node that shows \"lymphoid hyperplasia.\"\\nThe malignant lymphoma\\nwas not identified; however, there was a \"skewed\" kappa to lambda ratio of plasma cells.\\nIn the past, I checked an immunoelectrophoresis, it was abnormal, it suggested perhaps a monoclonal protein.\\nShe does not show any overt signs of a plasma cell disorder or a lymphoma; however, it is a little worrisome that her white count is creeping up without any sign of infection, so I not only am going to repeat the immunoelectrophoresis, the serum protein electrophoresis, I will get free light chains, a beta-2 and leukemia lymphoma phenotyping on her peripheral blood. We will review those findings when they come back.\\nIf all goes well; however, we will see her in six months.\\nShe will have had her mammogram by then.\\n4.\\nForgetfulness.\\nHead CT showing aneurysms.\\nPlans per Dr. Person6 and the physician she is seeing in Location.\\n\\n\\n ______________________________\\nPerson93, MD\\n\\nElectronically signed by: Person93, MD on 08/31/2012 at 10:43 AM\\n\\n\\nD:  08/30/2012 01:09PM, DP\\nT:  08/31/2012 06:06AM, pn\\nR:  08/31/2012 07:37AM\\n Confirmation #: 221114 / Document ID: 631769\\n\\n\\ncc: Person161 M.D.\\n Person33 MD\\n Person221, PhD, FACRO\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', '4@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', '5@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', '6@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', '7@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', '8@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', '9@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', '10@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['Arimidex', 'chemotherapy', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex', 'Arimidex'], 'span': [[791, 799], [1518, 1530], [1645, 1653], [1673, 1681], [3126, 3134], [5353, 5361], [5383, 5391], [5583, 5591]], 'id': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]}, 'time': {'ment_id': ['3@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', '11@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold'], 'ment': ['April 2012', 'for five years'], 'span': [[803, 813], [5592, 5606]], 'id': [0, 1]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient129_report048_NOTE@gold', 'ment': '20120830', 'span': [229, 237]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}}, 'patient155': {'report017_PGN': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................1058,kVEjWoT9efcg\\nPatient ID....................kVEjWoT9efcg\\nPatient Name..................Patient155\\nPrincipal Date................20080905 0000\\nRecord Type...................PGN\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\n\\nDIAGNOSIS:  Stage 1 (T1A N0 M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma right breast\\nstatus post segmental mastectomy and sentinel node dissection.\\n\\nREASON FOR VISIT:  Postoperative followup.\\n\\nPatient155 is seen in the office today for a scheduled followup visit.  She\\nunderwent the above surgery on 8/28/08.  At this visit her chief complaint is\\nsensation of fullness in the right breast.  She hears a \"sloshing\" noise when\\nher breast is jostled.  She denies any wound redness or drainage.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The breast and axillary incisions are clean, dry and\\nintact.  There is an obvious palpable fluid collection in the right breast.\\nThe right breast was prepped with Betadine and with aseptic technique 60 cc of\\nserous sanguinous fluid was aspirated.\\n\\nThe final pathology was previously reviewed with the patient by telephone, but\\ndiscussed again today.  The specimen confirms invasive ductal carcinoma.\\nNottingham score is 7/9 or grade II.  There is no evidence of lymphovascular\\nspace invasion.  There is also a component of ductal carcinoma in situ\\ncribriform and papillary types nuclear grade II with comedonecrosis.  The\\nsurgical resection margins are negative.  The invasive carcinoma is estrogen\\nreceptor positive, H-score of 190, progesterone receptor negative score of 0,\\nHER-2 neu was 3+ on immunohistic chemistry.  The right axillary sentinel lymph\\nnode was negative for malignancy.\\n\\nDISCUSSION:  The pathology indicates a small primary infiltrating ductal\\ncarcinoma.  Surgical resection margins are negative and the axillary lymph node\\nis also negative.  At this point I would not recommended additional surgery.\\n\\nThe invasive tumor does have some negative prognostic features, including the\\nfact that it is positive for over expression of HER-2 neu.  In spite of this,\\nthe size of the small primary tumor may indicate that she may not require\\nadjuvant systemic chemotherapy.  Patient will be referred to medical oncology\\nfor  a consultation.

de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\nDIAGNOSIS:  Stage 1 (T1A N0 M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma right breast status post segmental mastectomy and sentinel node dissection.\\n\\nREASON FOR VISIT:  Postoperative followup.\\n\\n Patient155 is seen in the office today for a scheduled followup visit.\\nShe underwent the above surgery on 8/28/08.\\nAt this visit her chief complaint is sensation of fullness in the right breast.\\nShe hears a \"sloshing\" noise when her breast is jostled.\\nShe denies any wound redness or drainage.\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The breast and axillary incisions are clean, dry and intact.\\nThere is an obvious palpable fluid collection in the right breast.\\nThe right breast was prepped with Betadine and with aseptic technique 60 cc of serous sanguinous fluid was aspirated.\\n\\n\\nThe final pathology was previously reviewed with the patient by telephone, but discussed again today.\\nThe specimen confirms invasive ductal carcinoma.\\nNottingham score is 7/9 or grade II.\\nThere is no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion.\\nThere is also a component of ductal carcinoma in situ cribriform and papillary types nuclear grade II with comedonecrosis.\\nThe surgical resection margins are negative.\\nThe invasive carcinoma is estrogen receptor positive, H-score of 190, progesterone receptor negative score of 0, HER-2 neu was 3+ on immunohistic chemistry.\\nThe right axillary sentinel lymph node was negative for malignancy.\\n\\n DISCUSSION:  The pathology indicates a small primary infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\\nSurgical resection margins are negative and the axillary lymph node is also negative.\\nAt this point I would not recommended additional surgery.\\n\\n\\nThe invasive tumor does have some negative prognostic features, including the fact that it is positive for over expression of HER-2 neu.\\nIn spite of this, the size of the small primary tumor may indicate that she may not require adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.\\nPatient will be referred to\\nmedical oncology for\\na consultation.\\nShe is aware that adjuvant whole breast radiation is recommended to complete her local care.\\nShe is requesting a referral to the Institution which is closer to her home.\\n\\n I outlined long term surveillance with the patient.\\nShe will followup in our office on an annual basis.\\nShe is due for a bilateral mammogram in July of 2009.\\n\\n\\n\\n_________________________\\n\\nPerson29, MD\\nAssociate Professor of Person8\\n\\n\\nThis document is electronically signed

At the time of the mammogram, she denied breast masses, skin\\nchanges, nipple retraction, or nipple discharge.  She has no prior history of\\nbreast biopsies or breast pathology.\\n\\nThe mammogram identified new calcifications in the right breast.  Diagnostic\\nmammography on July 3, 2008, demonstrated a new cluster of calcifications in\\nthe right upper outer quadrant.  There are actually 3 clusters of\\ncalcifications within a 2 cm area.\\n\\nOn July 11, 2008, a stereotactic core needle biopsy of the most suspicious\\ngroup of calcifications was performed, and the final pathology was positive for\\ninvasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 2, with ductal carcinoma in situ,\\nnuclear grade 2, cribriform type, with comedo necrosis.  The invasive carcinoma\\nis estrogen receptor positive, H-score of 190, progesterone receptor negative,\\nscore of zero.  HER-2/neu is 3+ positive.  KI-67 was moderate at 20%.\\n\\nShe went on to have a bilateral breast MRI performed today for further\\nevaluation.  Those results will be discussed below.\\n\\nHer family history includes 2 maternal cousins with breast cancer.  The cousins\\nwere not sisters.  Both were in their late 50s or early 60s at the time of\\ndiagnosis.  She has 2 sisters with no history of breast cancer.  Her mother has\\nno history of carcinoma.  She had the onset of menses at age 16.  She had a\\ntotal abdominal hysterectomy in 2001.  She is not on hormone replacement\\ntherapy.  She is gravida 1, para 1, and was 29 with the birth of her first\\nchild.\\n\\nHer past medical history is negative for hypertension, diabetes, or pulmonary\\ndisease.  Past surgical history, TAH, and cholecystectomy.  . John's wort, black cohosh, fish oil, and calcium.  SHE IS\\nALLERGIC TO PERCOCET WHICH CAUSES NAUSEA.  SHE HAS NO LATEX ALLERGY.\\n\\nReview of systems is documented in my office chart and was reviewed with the\\npatient today.  She reports stress incontinence and urinary frequency.  She has\\narthritis in her neck.  All other organ systems are reviewed and negative.\\n\\nSocial history:  She works as an electronic assembler.  She is married and\\nlives with her husband.  She currently does not smoke.  She quit smoking 15\\nyears ago.  She has a 20-pack-year smoking history.  She rarely drinks alcohol.\\n\\n\\nOn physical examination, this is a healthy appearing woman in no acute\\ndistress.  Blood pressure is 120/80, height 5 feet 4 inches.  Weight is 182\\npounds.  A comprehensive breast exam was performed with the patient sitting and\\nrecumbent.  Her breasts are large in size.  Bra size is 40D.  There is no\\nerythema or edema of the breast skin.  The nipples are everted without crusting\\nor excoriation.  There is a core biopsy insertion site in the 10 o'clock\\nposition of the right breast.  Mild fibroglandular thickening is appreciated at\\nthe site of the core biopsy.  No discrete mass is identified.  She has no right\\naxillary or supraclavicular adenopathy.  The left breast is negative for masses\\nor suspicious fibroglandular thickening.  There is no left axillary or\\nsupraclavicular adenopathy.\\n\\nI independently reviewed the screening and diagnostic mammogram on our stentor\\nsystem.  The results are as outlined in the history of present illness.\\n\\nThe MRI performed this morning has not been officially read.  The images were\\nreviewed on our Stentor system.  There is an area of abnormal enhancement in\\nthe upper outer quadrant 10 o'clock position of the right breast.  This\\ncorresponds to the biopsy proven breast cancer.  It appears to extend over an\\napproximately 2 to 2.5 cm area.  Somewhat inferior to this is a second\\nabnormally enhancing lesion.  This is concerning for a separate focus of\\ncarcinoma.\\n\\nMy impression is the patient is a 54-year-old woman who presents with a\\nscreening-detected clinical stage I (T1c N0 M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma\\nof the right breast, ER positive, PR negative, HER-2/neu 3+ positive.  Her MRI\\ntoday demonstrates a separate suspicious enhancing focus in the right breast.\\n\\nI would recommend an MRI-guided biopsy of the MRI-detected lesion to determine\\nif she has a multifocal carcinoma.  If the biopsy is positive, then a larger\\nsegmental excision would be recommended.  Her tumor is HER-2/neu positive;\\ntherefore, she will be a candidate for adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of\\nHerceptin.  In the event that she has a multifocal infiltrating carcinoma,\\nprimary chemotherapy may be considered to decrease the volume of breast tissue\\nnecessary at the time of segmental mastectomy.\\n\\nWe will coordinate the MRI-guided biopsy to be done at Institution as\\nsoon as possible.

At the end of August of this year,\\nthe patient presented with right lower extremity pain and weakness and upon\\nan x-ray the patient was found to have patchy osteopenia of right inferior\\npubic ramus and right femoral shaft, it is concerning for metastatic\\ndisease.  The patient was also noted to have a large fungating mass in her\\nleft breast parenchyma.  On September 3, 2013, the patient underwent an IM\\nnailing of her right femur for impending pathological fracture and also\\nunderwent a biopsy of her fungating left breast mass which proved to be\\ninvasive ductal carcinoma.  This was shown to be ER positive, PR positive\\nwith Ki-67 of 60%.  The patient's tumor was sent out for HER-2 positivity\\nby fluorescent in situ hybridization but this analysis has not been\\ncompleted and the report is not currently available.  The patient also\\nunderwent a bone scan on September 3, which revealed diffuse metastatic\\ndisease including inferior left scapula, right femur, right pubic ramus,\\nright humeral shaft and left lower sternum.  A thoracic MRI was completed\\non September 5, 2013 that showed metastatic disease to her T5, T8-T9, L1,\\nleft posterior rib, right posterior ribs, but no cord compression.  The\\npatient was evaluated by Medical Oncology and will be starting anastrozole\\nand Faslodex as soon as the patient is stable.  We are consulted for\\npalliative radiotherapy to be given to her left breast, left axilla, and\\nright femur, status post IM nailing.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CVA in September of 2010, PE and DVT, hypertension,\\ndiabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia.\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Breast cancer in sister.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed.

We had\\na long conversation with Ms. Patient143 regarding the risks, benefits, side\\neffects, and rationale of treatment with palliative radiotherapy for her\\nleft breast lesion as well as the axillary lymphadenopathy.  We also\\ndiscussed the same for her right femoral postoperative treatment in order\\nto facilitate her healing.  The patient understands that this is purely a\\npalliative treatment and that the goal of care is not to cure the patient\\nunfortunately.  The patient had ample opportunity to ask questions and to\\nhave all of her concerns addressed.  At the end of this conversation, the\\npatient gave consent to undergo treatment and will soon undergo CT\\nsimulation in our department today and start treatment tomorrow.  We also\\ndiscussed her case with Dr. Person62 who gave us the clearance for\\nher to undergo postoperative therapy to her right femur.\\n______________________________\\nElectronically authenticated at end of document.\\nDictated by: Person58, M.D.\\n*U*P*M*C* Patient143#:\\nD:  09/10/2013 04:33PM, CHK T:  09/10/2013 05:19PM, mn  R: 09/10/2013 11:46PM\\ntt Confirmation # / Document ID: \\nAuthenticated by Person2, MD On 09/16/2013 02:07:34 PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'pair_wise': {'chemo': {'ment_id': ['2@e@patient143_report063_HP@gold', '3@e@patient143_report063_HP@gold'], 'ment': ['anastrozole', 'Faslodex'], 'span': [[2461, 2472], [2477, 2485]], 'id': [0, 1]}, 'time': {'ment_id': [], 'ment': [], 'span': [], 'id': []}, 'chemo_time_rel': {}}, 'doc_create_time': {'ment_id': '1@e@patient143_report063_HP@gold', 'ment': '20130910', 'span': [230, 238]}, 'chemo_time_rel': {'rel_id': [], 'source_id': [], 'target_id': [], 'rel_type': [], 'tlink_type': []}}, 'report004_HP': {'raw_note': '===================================================================\\nReport ID.....................2603,AjQao78hvJZm\\nPatient ID....................AjQao78hvJZm\\nPatient Name..................Patient143\\nPrincipal Date................20130831 1359\\nRecord Type...................HP\\n===================================================================\\n[Report de-identified (Limited dataset compliant) by De-ID v.6.24.5.1]\\n\\n\\nHistory and Physical:\\n\\nInstitution\\n\\nPatient: Patient143 MRN:  FIN: \\nAge: 78 years Sex: Female DOB: 11/5/1934\\nAssociated Diagnoses: None\\nAuthor: Person31\\n\\nBasic Information\\nVisit Information : Patient seen on 8/31/2013.\\n\\nChief Complaint\\nRight leg pain\\n\\nHistory of Present Illness\\nPatient is a 78 year old woman with past medical history of left sided\\ncortical stroke back in 2010 resulting in right sided hemiparesis, DVT and PEs\\nin the past presenting with complaints of right sided leg pain during\\nambulation that started two days ago.

This was discussed with\\nher daughter and son-in-law present.\\n\\nCurrently the patient is very little pain except when she bears weight on the\\nleg.
