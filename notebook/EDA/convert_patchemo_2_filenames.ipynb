08/13/1955\\nDOV: 04/16/2013\\n\\nOffice Note\\n\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is here with concerns about right arm redness, swelling and pain.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a very pleasant 57-year-old woman with history of recently diagnosed left breast cancer, status post surgery and first cycle of chemotherapy, presents to clinic with the above symptoms.\\nThe patient received her first dose of chemotherapy with Adriamycin and Cytoxan on April 4, 2013.\\nThis is her first of four planned cycles separated by an interval of 3 weeks for recently diagnosed T2 N0 M0 IDC of the left breast that is triple negative.\\nThe patient reports that approximately 3 days after her chemotherapy infusion via the right arm peripheral IV catheter, she started to complain of stiffness and soreness around her elbow.\\nShe did not think much of it initially; however, following that, she started to note some bruising and yellow-green discoloration over the right dorsal forearm vein that seemed to worsen over a few-day period.\\nApproximately 3 days ago, she started to notice redness over the medial aspect of her right elbow region that has been extending downwards accompanied by soreness, warmth and hotness over her right arm.\\nShe has had absolutely no fevers or chills.\\nNo constitutional symptoms with these symptoms.\\nShe had blood work done one day prior as per her chemotherapy protocol.\\nThe patient reports that she is a high school teacher and is right-handed and did have difficulty completing her writing on the black board at the high school.\\nThe patient did contact her oncologist's office and was advised to see her PCP regarding the above-mentioned symptoms.\\nThe patient denies any itching or hives.\\nThe redness is limited to the right medial elbow region.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Apart from what is mentioned in the HPI, is otherwise negative.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has a history of migraines and history of recently diagnosed T2 N0 M0 IDC of the left breast that is triple negative, status post lumpectomy.\\nShe is also status post first cycle of Adriamycin and Cytoxan out of 4 cycles.\\nFollowing that, she will be receiving radiation therapy and IV Taxol as part of her chemotherapy regimen.\\nShe has a history of anxiety, osteoporosis, hypertension and hyperlipidemia.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO BACTRIM, ADALAT, CLONIDINE, PENICILLIN, PRAVACHOL, AND ZOCOR.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include Fiorinal p.r.n. for migraines, calcium plus vitamin D supplements, Zyrtec 10 mg p.r.n. for allergies, Decadron 4 mg 1 tablet every 6 hours x6 doses starting the evening after each chemotherapy, Benadryl as needed, Paxil 10 mg daily, Compazine p.r.n. for nausea, Actonel 35 mg weekly, Imitrex p.r.n. and verapamil 120 mg daily.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a high school teacher, teaches English at Central Catholic High School.\\nShe does not smoke, does not drink alcohol and does not use any drugs.\\nThe patient is married, lives with her husband.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Her height is 4 feet 10.75, her weight is 95 pounds, BMI is 19, blood pressure 112/74, heart rate 100 and regular.\\nGENERAL:  She looks a little anxious, but she is otherwise in no acute distress.\\nHEAD AND NECK:  No pallor, no JVD.\\nOropharynx is overall unremarkable.\\nMucous membranes moist without any ulcers.\\nNECK:  Soft and supple.\\nNo cervical adenopathy.\\nCHEST:  Clear to auscultation.\\nGood breath sounds.\\nNo wheezes or crackles.\\nHEART:  Normal S1, S2.\\nNo S3, S4.\\nI could not hear any murmurs.\\nShe was borderline tachycardic.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft.\\nNo hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, rebound, rigidity or tenderness.\\nEXTREMITIES:  Examination of her legs reveals no peripheral edema, rashes, clubbing, or cyanosis.\\nExamination of her right upper extremity reveals\\nmild discoloration and bruising just distal to her wrist dorsally at the site of the previous IV peripheral catheter.\\nPalpation of the vein in that distribution yields a cord-like, hard, tender structure without any erythema.\\nExamination of her elbow region reveals two\\nareas of redness extending from the elbow distally down towards her forearm.\\nThey are erythematous, hot, tender, and there is underlying cord-like structure in both of those locations as well.\\nThis area was marked with a pen.\\nLeft upper extremity without any rashes or edema or erythema.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 57-year-old woman status post first cycle of Adriamycin and Cytoxan for breast cancer, developed erythema, redness, hotness and swelling approximately 7 days following her infusion.\\nAt this time, she seems to have a superficial thrombophlebitis at the site of her previous IV infusion, most likely induced by chemotherapy given via peripheral catheter.\\nMy concern is possible cellulitis given the fact that her CBC from this morning shows absolute neutropenia and leukopenia with a white count of 0.7.\\nShe is also mildly thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of 85,000.\\nAt this time, she is afebrile, but I am worried about potential infection.\\nTherefore, we will treat her empirically with Keflex 500 mg q.i.d. for 7 days and will follow her up in approximately 48 hours.\\nIf there is no improvement, may consider broadening the antibiotic coverage and/or IV antibiotics if she shows any signs of worsening.\\nTHE PATIENT ALLERGIC TO BACTRIM, therefore it cannot be used as first line.\\nI would also encourage her to use warm compresses over the affected area and use better pain control.\\nIdeally NSAIDs would be given.\\nHowever, due to the fact that she is thrombocytopenic, I would have her stay away from nonsteroidals and use a narcotic-based pain killer, which she has at home left over from her breast surgery that she actually did not use.\\nThe\\npatient was also advised to keep her arm elevated, I would prefer that she skip work tomorrow to allow her arms to heal and see her back on Thursday to reassess the situation.\\nThe patient is also advised to her oncologist about this occurrence since she is scheduled for repeat second cycle chemotherapy next week.\\nThis case was also discussed with the patient's PCP, Dr. Person27.\\nThe rest of her medical problems will be treated as per previous.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nPerson6,

I have discussed the case with the mid-level provider, reviewed the note, history and physical examination as documented by the mid-level provider, formulated the medical decision making, and agree with the documentation included for this visit. I have also assessed a 14 point review of systems which is positive as per the mid-level note and otherwise unremarkable. The patient\\'s past medical history, past surgical history, medications, allergies, review of systems, and psychosocial history was independently reviewed as evidenced by my dated signatures on the electronic medical record created on the day of her office encounter.\\n\\n I have personally performed the medical decision making and would like to add: Mrs. Patient47 is seen today as a new patient referred by Dr. Person2. She has newly diagnosed triple negative breast cancer. Her tumor is 2.2 cm, node (-), grade 3.\\nWe reviewed the rationale, and benefits of chemotherapy. Given her high risk, node (-) phenotype, I recommend 4 cycles of AC followed by 12 weeks of taxol. I also discussed participation in NSABP trial of TC x 6 vs. AC-T. She has declined trial participation.\\n\\n I discussed the risks, benefits, and expected side effects which include alopecia, pancytopenia, increased risk of infection with the myelosuppression, anemia, and thrombocytopneia. We discussed gastrointestinal toxicity including nausea and vomiting, esophagitis, and diarrhea, most of which can typically be managed with medications. We discussed the cardiac toxicity with Adriamycin with risk of clinically significant heart failure at less than 1%. We discussed the rare complication of secondary leukemia with with Adriamycin and Cytoxan. I discussed neuropathy with the Taxol. We also discussed side effects such as mild cognitive\\ndecline \"chemo\" brain, skin and nail changes, flulike\\nsymptoms, and generalized fatigue. The benefit of this treatment is to help reduce the risk of distant disease recurrence.\\n\\nShe will get a MUGA and return in a few weeks to start chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The patient has undergone a left segmental mastectomy, and completed only 2 cycles of chemotherapy because of toxicity.\\n\\nPatient10 just recently started her Arimidex 2 weeks ago. After being on the medicine for about 10 days she noticed some breast pain and swelling. She\\'s also noticed some fatigue. She otherwise tolerated the Arimidex. On physical exam she does have some shrinkage, skin thickening, and density noted in her left breast. I suspect that at least part of this is radiation change related. However she is due for her annual mammogram and breast MRI and we will proceed with this in particular to rule out any evidence of local recurrence. If this is all unremarkable we will see her back here in 3 months and she will continue on her Arimidex. I strongly encouraged her to restart Arimidex, and stressed the importance of this\\nmedicine appear. If there are any issues on the imaging, we will move forward as appropriate. She is now more open at this time to the idea of doing bilateral mastectomies with reconstruction. We can refer her to plastic surgery. As far as her ovaries, she is following with gynecology. She is thinking about doing oopherectomy in the new year. She is due for a pelvic ultrasound and we\\'ve given her prescription for this today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

She is + for BRCA2 (her daughter had breast cacner last year and was BRCA+). She had routine imaging and was found to have an indeterminate nodule. This was biopsied and consistent with breast cancer. This was ER+ at H score 270, PR + H score 300, and Her2 negative. The Ki67 was moderate. She went on to have segmental mastectomy which showed a 1.9 cm tumor, nodes were negative.\\nWe discussed the management of ER+, node (-) breast cancer. We discussed the many times these tumors will have a favorable prognosis. We discussed that the mainstay of her therapy will be with an aromatase inhibitor, which she will take for 5 years. We discussed that there may be a benefit to chemo and that we can further assess this using an oncotype DX test. This RT-PCR based test will assess gene expression in her tumor that can help to predict the risk or recurrence and benefit of chemotherapy. We will send this off and she will return in 3 weeks to review results. If her tumor comes back intermediate or high, we may want to consider adding\\nplatinum to her adjuvant chemo in light of the BRCA mutation.\\n She will RTC in 3 weeks ot review the oncotype.\\n\\n Of note, her daughter was with her today who has not been BRCA tested and I stressed the importance of this and provided her with info for the high risk clinic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

No diarrhea. She presented to the ED where she was found to have a lipase\\n7000, CT A/P showed pancreatitis with evidence of choledocholithiasis. She was kept NPO and placed on IVF's. She was seen by GI who ordered an MRCP which was\\nnegative for CBD stone. She clinically improved with decrease in her pain, her LFT's and amylase and lipase. She had marked leukocytosis on admission thought to be due to neualsta +/- her pancreatitis which continued to decrease throughout her hospitalization. She did have fevers in the evenings and was pancultured. Her BC's and urine culture are all NGTD. Her CXR showed LLL atelectasis and she was instructed to use an incentive spirometer. She was seen by surg-onc, Dr Person32 who wanted to wait 1-2 weeks before doing a cholecystectomy. Her diet was advanced to low fat which she tolerated. She will f/u with Dr Person16 on 4/29 at 4:00 pm and will f/u with Dr Person32 within the next week to schedule her cholecystectomy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResults Review\\n Procedures and Tests\\n\\n X-Ray results: Chest Anterior Xray\\nPerformed Date: April 23, 2013 11:40 PM\\n Result Status: Final\\nResult Title: XRAY CHEST FRONTAL VIEW\\nEncounter info: , Institution, Inpatient, 4/21/2013 -\\n\\n * Final Report *\\nXRCH1V\\nCLINICAL HISTORY:  Rule out PNA.\\n\\n COMPARISON:  04/23/2013 at 2:10 p.m.\\n\\n TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-erect projection of the chest.\\n\\n FINDINGS:  The heart size is normal.

The spleen, adrenals and kidneys are unremarkable\\n with a probable tiny cyst in the left kidney which is not well\\n assessed.\\n\\n Peripancreatic infiltration indicates acute pancreatitis. A 3-4 mm\\n calcific density near the level of the ampulla on series 3 image 33\\n is likely from a recently passed choledocholith.

The following sequences were obtained: Axial and\\n coronal T2 SSFSE, axial T1 FSPGR, 2-D thick slab MRCP, 3-D MRCP with\\n breath-hold, 3-D MRCP respiratory trigger\\n\\n FINDINGS:  The examination is moderately compromised secondary to motion. There\\n is decreased T1 signal within the pancreatic parenchyma with\\n engorgement of the pancreatic body and tail. There is peripancreatic\\n edema and pancreatic interstitial edema. There is trace abdominal\\n ascites. A small amount of fluid is noted within the left anterior\\n pararenal space. There is cholelithiasis within a mildly distended\\n gallbladder.\\n\\n No significant intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation\\n is present. The common hepatic duct measures up to 6 mm. No\\n pancreatic ductal dilatation is present. Narrowing of distal common\\n bile duct is noted upstream from the ampulla. Mild thickening of the\\n ampulla is best seen on 3-D MRCP sequence. Due to the low signal of\\n this structure on MRI, persistence of the ampullary calculus cannot\\n be assessed. No filling defects are seen within the common duct to\\n suggest choledocholithiasis.\\n\\n Note is made of mild fluid distention of proximal small bowel likely\\n related to mild ileus.\\n\\n IMPRESSION:  1.\\nModerately compromised examination secondary to motion.\\n2.\\nMR findings compatible with acute interstitial pancreatitis.\\n3.\\nMild thickening of the ampulla as seen on the 3-D MRCP sequence\\n is consistent with ampullary edema.

She most recently received chemo on April 2,\\n2013, with last on April 3, 2013.\\nShe was admitted from April 11 to April\\n13, with a low-grade fever, nausea and constipation.\\nCT scan showed\\npossible colitis, but this was felt to be secondary primarily to\\nconstipation.\\nShe was feeling better, but on April 20, had the onset of\\nrather severe sharp epigastric pain associated with nausea and 3 episodes\\nof emesis.\\nThe pain persisted, so she came to the Emergency Department and\\nwas admitted for pancreatitis.\\nShe has no history of alcohol in the past\\nand is a nonsmoker.\\nHer lipase on admission was greater than 7000.\\nOn\\nrepeat the lipase is 1668.\\nHer LFTs on admission showed an AST of 63 and\\nALT of 195.\\nOn repeat, her ALT went to 139 with an AST of 44, bilirubin\\n0.8, and alkaline phosphatase of 81.\\nAlbumin 3.7, total protein 6.7,\\nrepeat albumin of 2.0 with a total protein of 5.5.\\n\\n\\nCT scan of the abdomen was reviewed and shows a possible 3-4 mm stone in\\nthe ampullary region; they thought the stone had passed. She had an MRCP\\nthis afternoon that is not read yet.\\nOn my review (for some reason, I\\ncould not enlarge the images),\\nI thought there may be several retained\\ndistal common bile duct stones.\\n\\nShe also has a history of GERD and an esophageal stricture that was dilated\\nabout a year ago at an outside hospital.\\nShe was told that she had erosive\\nesophagitis.\\nShe took PPI for 1 month and then discontinued it.\\nShe now\\ncontinues to have heartburn for which she takes intermittent Tums 3 or 4\\ntimes a week.\\nA colonoscopy 1 year ago at an outside hospital was normal.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above.\\nThere is a strong family history of colon\\nand breast cancer.\\n\\nHOME MEDICATIONS:  Include ibuprofen and Ambien.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  SHE IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN AND SULFADIAZINE.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  She is an alert female in no acute distress.\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Stable.\\nLUNGS:  Clear.\\nABDOMEN:  She has minimal tenderness in her epigastric area.\\n\\nADDITIONAL LABORATORIES:  Sodium 140, potassium 4.1, chloride 110, CO2\\n21.4, BUN 12, creatinine 0.8.\\nWBC 29,500, H and H of 10.9/33.4, and\\nplatelets 451,000.\\nINR 1.0.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  PROBABLE GALLSTONE PANCREATITIS WITH RETAINED COMMON BILE DUCT\\nSTONES.\\nWe will check MRCP results, but if it confirms retained common\\nbile duct stones, then she probably should have an ERCP to remove the\\nstones.\\nThere is a risk of pancreatitis with ERCP, but with retained\\nstones, there is also risk of exacerbating the pancreatitis and so ERCP\\nwould probably be preferred at this time.\\nAfter ERCP, she should have an\\nelective cholecystectomy.\\nI do not think she has cholangitis at this time\\nand that the increase in white count is probably secondary to her _____.\\n\\nShe does have a history of erosive esophagitis with a stricture and should\\nbe on a PPI chronically to prevent future damage.\\nThis was discussed with\\nthe family.\\nWe will review the MRCP and if a retained stone is confirmed,\\nwe would probably proceed with an ERCP tomorrow.\\n\\nThanks for allowing us to participate in Mrs. Patient10's care.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\nElectronically authenticated at end of document.\\n\\n Dictated by: Person13, M.D.\\nD:  04/22/2013 09:40PM, LMW T:  04/22/2013 10:23PM, cap\\nR:  Confirmation # 912077/ Document ID: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

She has not had an MRI of the breast.\\nShe was asymptomatic at the time of her screening mammogram November 28, 2012 which revealed an indeterminate nodule in her left breast. A diagnostic mammogram with ultrasound was obtained December 4, these exams identified a 1.8 cm spiculated mass at the 2:00 position of the left breast.\\n The left axilla was unremarkable\\nUltrasound guided core biopsy was obtained December 4 and consistent with infiltrating ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 3. The estrogen receptor was positive H. score 270, progesterone receptor positive H. score 300, the HER-2 was negative by IHC score 1+ and\\nthe K I-67 proliferation index was moderately high at 20%.\\nMs. Patient10 ultimately decided to pursue a segmental mastectomy rather than bilateral mastectomies. This was completed on January 13, 2013. Pathology was consistent with a 1.9cm IDC, nuclear grade 3 and Nottingham score 7/9.\\nThe specimen was negative for lymphovascular space invasion.

Of note her WBC was quite high which was likely secondary in part to the Neulasta as well as the infection. She is feeling better now. She will be receiving a cholecystectomy with Dr. Person2 in the near future. She is decided that she doesn\\'t want any additional chemotherapy. I did discuss with her that it is hard to say that the chemotherapy had any influence on the gallstone pancreatitis. Likely this was an incidental thing and it does not pose a contraindication to continuing her chemotherapy after the surgery.\\nBREAST CANCER HISTORY:  Breast Cancer Characteristics:  1 2 3 4\\n Stage IA (T1c N0 M0)\\n\\n\\n\\n Stage Details\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Side Left\\n\\n\\n\\n Type IDC\\n\\n\\n\\n Dx Date 12/6/2012\\n\\n\\n\\n Tumor Size 1.9cm\\n\\n\\n\\n Lymph Node 0/2+\\n\\n\\n\\n ER/ER H-Score + 270\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PR/PR H-Score + 300\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Her-2/neu -\\n\\n\\n\\n IHC 1+\\n\\n\\n\\n FISH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Copy #\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n PCR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Ki-67% 20%\\n\\n\\n\\n Grade 3\\n\\n\\n\\n Nottingham Score 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n BRCA:  2+\\nOncotype Dx:  26\\n\\n\\nComments:  Biopsies / Surgeries:  Procedure Provider Side Date Completed Comments\\n US Guided Core Breast Biopsy\\n Left 12/6/2012\\n\\n Segmental Mastectomy with Sentinel Node Biopsy\\n Left 1/11/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Comments:  Medical Oncology Therapies:\\nDrug Name Person9 Cycles Date Started Date Completed\\nReason Discontinued\\n Comments\\n Docetaxel/Cyclophosphamide Person210 4 3/12/2013\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Comments:  Radiation Oncology Therapies:  Site Provider Side # of Fractions Date Started Date Completed Reason Discontinued Comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Labs and radiology reviewed\\n\\nAllergies\\n Allergen Reactions\\n  Bee Stings Anaphylaxis\\n\\n anaphylaxis\\n  Celestone (Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate)\\n\\n Penicillins Rash\\n  Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics) Rash\\n\\n Rash & itching\\n  Xylocaine (Lidocaine Hcl)\\n\\n\\n\\nOutpatient Prescriptions Marked as Taking for the 4/30/13 encounter (Office Visit) with Person15/Np, Person12\\n Medication Sig Dispense Refill\\n  acetaminophen (TYLENOL) 325 mg Oral tablet as needed\\n\\n\\n  AMBIEN 10 MG TAB prn\\n\\n\\n  Ibuprofen (MOTRIN) 800 mg Oral tablet prn\\n\\n\\n\\n Past Medical History\\n Diagnosis Date\\n Hx other medical\\n\\n + breast cancer gene, BrCa 2\\n Adv eff anesthesia nos 1979\\n\\nHypotensive with medication prior to delivery\\n Chronic kidney disease nos\\n\\n kidney stones\\n\\n Past Surgical History\\n Procedure Date\\n Tubal ligation\\n\\nTonsillectomy/adenoidectomy\\n\\nHx other surgical\\n\\n cervical cerclage\\n Tonsillectomy / adenoidectomy 1965\\n\\n Family History\\nProblem Relation Age of Onset\\n  Ca,Breast Mother 30\\n\\n with pregnancy died at 46\\n  Ca,Other Mother\\n\\n\\nlung ca\\n  Ca,Breast Daughter 38\\n\\n Person8\\n  Ca,Other Father\\n\\n\\nbrain\\n  Ca,Breast Maternal Grandmother 40\\n  Ca,Ovarian No History of\\n\\n\\nHistory\\n Substance Use Topics\\n  Smoking status: Never Smoker\\n\\n Smokeless tobacco: Never Used\\n  Alcohol Use: 1.5 oz/week\\n\\n 3 Glasses of wine per week\\n\\n\\n Breast Health and Related Information:  Bra Size: 36C\\nDo you perform self breast exams?: Yes\\nMenarche - Age: 12\\nAge at 1st Pregnancy: 21\\nHave you ever breast fed your child?: Yes\\nMenopause Date: age 51\\nHRT Past Use: No\\nHRT Current Use: No\\nPast Use of Birth Control: Yes\\nPresent Use of Birth Control: No\\nBirth Control Duration: 2 yrs\\n\\n\\nThe Self Assessment, Medication, Surgical, Medical, Allergies, Social and Family history stated above was reviewed with the patient during this visit.\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Constitutional:  fatigue\\nEyes:  No complaints\\nHENT: No complaints\\nRespiratory:  No complaints\\nCardiovascular:  No complaints\\nGI:  Better overall, had been having abdominal pain and diarrhea\\nGU:  No complaints\\n Musculoskeletal: no complaints\\nIntegument: No complaints\\nNeurologic:  No complaints\\nEndocrine:  No complaints\\nLymphatic:  No complaints\\nPsychiatric:  No complaints\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  General Appearance: Well developed, well nourished, white female in no acute distress, accompanied by family.

She is due to have her cholecystectomy. We will further discuss her case at our tumor board and move forward from there. I did discuss with her that it is unknown if she would receive any benefit at all for the 2 cycles that she had of TC. My bias would be to complete the 4 planned cycles of Taxotere and Cytoxan. We could resume this after she is recovered from her cholecystectomy. She is leaning more towards stopping. At any rate we will\\nhave her proceed with her cholecystectomy in followup here afterwards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I have discussed the case with the fellow, reviewed the note, history and physical examination as documented by the fellow, formulated the medical decision making, and agree with the documentation included for this visit. I have also assessed a 14 point review of systems which is positive as per the fellow\\'s note and otherwise unremarkable. The patient\\'s past medical history, past surgical history, medications, allergies, review of systems, and psychosocial history was independently reviewed as evidenced by my dated signatures on the electronic medical record created on the day of her office encounter.\\n Mrs. Patient10 is here today to review the results of her oncotype score which is a score of 26. This is in the high intermediate range and corresponds to a risk of recurrence of 17% on tamoxifen. We discussed that my recommendation is for chemotherapy. I typically recommend chemotherapy for any score > 25, weighing in other patient factors. I would recommend 4 cycles of TC. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and side effects which include alopecia, pancytopenia, increased risk of infection with the myelosuppression, anemia, and thrombocytopneia. We discussed gastrointestinal toxicity including nausea and vomiting, esophagitis, and diarrhea, all of which can typically be managed with medications. We discussed neuropathy with the Taxane. We also discussed side effects such as mild cognitive\\ndecline \"chemo\" brain, skin and nail changes, flulike symptoms, and generalized fatigue. The benefit oft his treatment is to help reduce the risk of distant disease recurrence.\\nShe is hesitant to go on chemotherapy and may choose hormonal therapy alone. She will think about her options and get back to us in the next few days with a final decision.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

seeing today in outpatient consultation upon request of Dr. Person27.\\nThe patient had a screening mammogram done on November 28, 2012, which demonstrated abnormality in the left breast.\\nIt was followed by ultrasound of the breast and diagnostic mammogram with biopsy of abnormality on December 24, 2012.\\nPathology came back as invasive mammary carcinoma, nuclear grade III.\\nIt was ER positive, PR positive, HER-2/neu negative and Ki-67 index was 20%.\\n\\n\\n Of note, the patient\\'s daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer as well and her disease was called BRCA2 positive.\\nThe patient was also tested for this mutation.\\nHer breast cancer was called BRCA2 positive as well.\\nShe decided to proceed with breast preservation.\\nShe was taken to operating room on January 11, 2012 and underwent wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy.\\nPathology from the left breast came back as invasive infiltrating ductal carcinoma measuring 1.9 cm.\\nIt was Nottingham grade II.\\nInvasive tumor was measuring 1.9 cm.\\nIt was mixed with DCIS without any obvious extensive intraductal component.\\nFinal surgical margins were negative with the closest margin for invasive carcinoma of 0.4 cm from the superior margin and 0.2 cm for DCIS for the near superior margin.\\nTwo sentinel lymph nodes were not involved.\\nThe patient met with Dr. Person32.\\nOncotype DX is pending at this time.\\nShe is here to discuss radiation therapy and management of her disease.\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She reports no lymphedema, no shortness of breath, no cough, no nausea, no vomiting, no abdominal pain, no fevers, and no breast pain.\\nReview of remaining 10 systems was negative.\\n\\n\\n PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hiatal hernia, arthritis, esophageal ulceration, GERD, and mitral valve prolapse.\\n\\n\\n PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Dental extractions, lumpectomy, tonsillectomy, tubal ligation, cervical cerclage.\\n\\n\\n CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Ibuprofen and Ambien as needed.\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN, SULFA AND LIDOCAINE, SKIN RASHES AND HIVES.\\nSHE IS ALSO ALLERGIC TO Person15.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies previous history of smoking, heavy alcohol

the left breast.\\nThe patient is tested positive for BRCA2 mutation.\\nShe also has extensive history of breast cancer in her family.\\nShe decided to proceed with breast preservation and had a wide local excision performed with final negative surgical margins.\\nThe closest margin was 0.4 cm.\\nTwo sentinel lymph nodes were not involved.\\nHer disease was ER/PR positive, HER-2/neu negative.\\nKi-67 index was 20%.\\nOncotype DX test was ordered and the results are pending at this time.\\nI discussed with this patient the rationale behind radiation therapy in the post-lumpectomy setting.\\nIt is being done to maximize the chances of local regional control.\\nShe is aware that if she has mastectomy done, there is no role for radiation therapy in the early stage breast cancer with her specific pathological features of the disease.\\nShe still desires to proceed with breast preservation.\\nI indicated that my preference is to use intensity modulated radiation therapy technique in order to decrease the dose to skin, lung, heart, and contralateral breasts and decrease the risk of grade II, grade III skin desquamation, radiation pneumonitis, pericarditis and secondary malignancies.\\nAt this point, I will await the results of Oncotype DX test.\\nShe is meeting with a medical oncologist on February 19, 2013.\\nIf there are plans for chemotherapy, then I

Patient was evaluated by myself, vital signs are stable. The patient had a complete laboratory workup performed, chest x-ray, urinalysis and abdominal x-ray. She was given normal saline solution 1 L IV here. The patient's urinalysis demonstrates urinary tract infection, or white blood cell count is elevated 94,000. She had a chest x-ray performed and abdominal x-ray which demonstrates no acute findings, with the exception of constipation. At this time Dr.Person16 was contacted who is her oncologist, and the patient was discussed with her. She recommends starting the patient on Cipro, and keeping her for observation with a repeat of her white blood cell count. At this time however Dr.Person16 does not admit here to the hospital, but agrees to accept the patient at Institution. Medical was notified, and the patient will be transferred via ambulance to medical. The patient verbalized an\\nunderstanding of her need for admission and transfer.

Idiopathic pancytopenia, as described above with negative with less than 10% cellularity at that time.\\nShe did have labs drawn recently that showed a white blood cell count of 3.3 with an ANC of 1.9, a hemoglobin of 14.4, and a platelet count of 125,000.\\nRelated to this, she does have a history of severe iron deficiency and has required IV iron in the past.\\n 2. Premature ovarian failure.\\nShe is currently in the midst of a infertility workup and this was discovered.\\nShe has been seen by the reproductive endocrinologist both here at Institution, as well as at the Institution, and it was recommended that if she was desirous of pregnancy she would need some type of fertility treatment.\\n 3. Scoliosis\\n 4. Irritable bowel syndrome\\n 5. The patient also has history of migraines.\\n\\n PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Significant for a D&E, laparoscopic surgery, and uterine surgery.\\nA colposcopy in 1997.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:  1. Axert\\n 2. Celebrex\\n 3. Zofran\\n 4. Ativan as needed\\n 5. She also gets IM B12.\\n\\n ALLERGIES:  DILAUDID WHICH CAUSES HIVES, KEFLEX CAUSES THRUSH, LATEX WHICH CAUSES SWELLING.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is an office manager for the neurology practice of Dr. Person47.\\nShe is married and lives with her husband and 5-year-old son.\\nHer 5-year-old son does have ADHD.\\nShe lives approximately an hour away in lower Person39.\\nShe denies tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a paternal great aunt with breast cancer, a paternal grandmother with postmenopausal breast cancer, paternal grandfather with sarcoma.\\nThere are multiple paternal relatives with hematologic malignancies including primarily multiple myeloma, a paternal uncle with prostate cancer, another paternal uncle with liver cancer.\\nHer mother has osteoporosis and hypercholesterolemia.\\nHer father is deceased from renal and heart failure.\\nShe does have an appointment with Genetics on Monday.\\n\\nGYNECOLOGIC HISTORY:  She is G2, P1.\\nShe had 1 miscarriage.\\nShe had menarche at age 12.\\nShe is not menstruating currently because of the premature ovarian failure.\\nHer last menstrual period was in June 2009.\\nShe was on birth control pills for approximately 5 or 6 years.\\nShe was 28 with her first pregnancy and did not breast feed.\\nShe has not taken any hormone replacement therapy.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  She is comfortable, well nourished, and in no acute distress.\\n\\nVITAL SIGNS:  Reviewed and are essentially unremarkable.\\nHEENT EXAM:  Pupils equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.\\nExtraocular muscles are intact.\\nSclerae anicteric.\\nOropharynx is clear.\\nNECK:  Supple.\\nThere is no lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or JVD.\\nLUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nNo wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.\\nHEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.\\nS1, S2.\\nNo murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\\nABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.\\nPositive bowel sounds.\\nNo hepatosplenomegaly.\\nEXTREMITIES:  No edema.\\nSKIN:  No rashes or lesions.\\nNEUROLOGIC EXAM:  Awake, alert, and oriented x3.\\nCranial nerves intact bilaterally.\\nStrength is 5/5, both upper and lower extremities bilaterally.\\nThere are no focal motor or sensory deficits noted.\\nGU EXAM:  There is no pain or masses palpable in suprapubic or flank area.\\nSKIN EXAM:  She has no rashes or lesions.\\nBREAST EXAM:  Exam reveals a 4.5 x 4 cm firm, moveable mass in the medial superior portion of the right breast.\\nThe left breast is unremarkable.\\nThere is no axillary, super or infraclavicular adenopathy present bilaterally.\\n\\nIMAGING DATA:  Her PET-CT was reviewed again significantly for the disease in the breast and no evidence of metastatic disease.\\nLaboratory evaluation is as reviewed in the history of present illness.\\nWe did repeat her labs today and this reveals normal chemistry and LFTs.\\nHer white blood cell count is 3.3.\\nHer ANC is 1870.\\nHer hemoglobin is 13.7.\\nPlatelet count is 133, 000.\\nThere is normal morphology.\\nHer coags are within normal limits.\\nHer MCV is 93, RDW is 13.4, both of which are within the normal range.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Person55 is a 33-year-old female with newly diagnosed, triple negative breast cancer.\\nShe has approximately a 4 cm mass in her breast.\\nThis is triple negative with basal phenotype.\\nI discussed with Person3 and her mom the rationale for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\\nI discussed with her the expected outcome of triple negative breast cancer when treated in the neoadjuvant setting.\\nThis includes about a 20% complete response rate, a 20% no response rate and approximately 60% partial response rate.\\nI discussed with her that we have data suggesting that people who respond well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy that this bodes well for them in the long run in terms of their eventual outcome with this disease.\\nDue to her young age, her phenotype and her family history, she is an appointment with Genetics that is scheduled in a few days.\\nDue to her poor IV access, we recommended a MediPort which we will arrange for her.\\nShe will also need a MUGA.\\nWe have also talked about chemotherapy.\\nMy recommendation would be 4 cycles of Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by 12 weeks of paclitaxel.\\nI believe that the weekly paclitaxel will allow us to better titrate her dosing for her blood counts.\\nMy plan would be to move forward with full dose if, in fact, she has been ANC greater than 1500 and a platelet count greater than 100,000 on day 1 of chemotherapy.\\nI would plan to treat her with growth factor support with Neulasta.\\nHer hemoglobin is fine now so hopefully this will continue to be okay throughout her disease course.\\nI discussed with her that it is essentially touch and go as to how well she would do from a hematologic standpoint with the chemotherapy.\\nHowever, her breast cancer is high risk due to her age and the triple negative phenotype.\\nTherefore, I would be inclined to treat her as aggressively as her marrow will tolerate in terms of the chemotherapy.\\nI think time has proven that she has done relatively well with this pancytopenia which would suggest against aplastic type process although she did have very hypocellular marrow.\\nHer counts have been relatively stable over time and are within the range that she should be able to tolerate chemotherapy well.\\nAgain, I informed her that this is something that we will have to wait and see how things go.\\nThe other concern that we spent some time talking about was the fertility issues.\\nShe does have a diagnosis of infertility going into chemotherapy and with the fact that she already has premature ovarian failure, she is at much higher rate of developing permanent ovarian failure/menopause with chemotherapy.\\nI will get in touch with the reproductive endocrinology folks and to see what she may be eligible for.\\nShe has been unable to pursue infertility treatment due to the cost and there are some programs available for oncology patient, which now she may be able to take advantage of.\\nWe will plan to get her started back here in a few weeks for chemotherapy.\\nIn the meantime, she will have port placement, MUGA replacement, review of her pathology, as well as meetings with the reproductive endocrinologist.\\n\\n\\nI would like to thank you for the referral of this patient.\\nI look forward to managing her care along with Dr. Person3 as well as Dr. Person29, and please do not hesitate to

We did consult\\nInfectious Disease, and they changed her antibiotics to Zosyn 4.5 grams IV\\nevery 8 hours. This was started on 09/08/2011. Blood cultures from 09/07/2011\\nand from 09/08/2011 were all negative. Fungal cultures were ordered and they\\ncontinue to be pending. An ultrasound above her port was completed at Institution. That report was obtained and was placed on the chart. She was\\ngiven oxycodone 2.5 mg by mouth every 4 hours as needed for pain, and she was\\nalso given Zofran as needed for nausea. The port was eventually removed on\\n09/13/2011. The patient tolerated this procedure without difficulty. Wound\\ncultures and port catheter cultures were negative, and the patient was sent\\nhome to complete a 14-day course of IV antibiotics. Home Care was consulted for\\nhome antibiotics.\\n2.   Breast cancer. She has a history of breast cancer, follows with Dr.\\nPerson8. She was seen by Dr. Person8 throughout this hospitalization. We did\\nalso consult the Breast Service for a breast abscess seen on CT scan which was\\ncompleted at Institution. We did order a breast ultrasound. It\\nwas a seroma from her prior surgical site. No surgical intervention was\\nrequired. She was given SCDs for DVT and discharged to home in stable\\ncondition.\\n\\nShe was sent home with the following instructions:\\n\\nHOME MEDICATIONS: Include:\\n1.   Prevacid 15 mg by mouth daily.\\n2.   Singular 10 mg by mouth every evening.\\n3.   Zofran 8 mg by mouth every 6 hours as needed for nausea or vomiting.\\n4.    Oxycodone 5 mg by mouth every 6 hours, 1 to 2 tablets by mouth every 6\\nhours as needed for pain. A prescription was provided by Dr. Person48 for\\n__________ tablets.\\n5.    Zosyn 4.5 grams IV every 8 hours for 14 days.\\n\\nShe was given a prescription for PICC line per protocol and also a work excuse.\\nShe has a diagnosis of cellulitis. She is to follow up with Dr. Person8 as\\nneeded and also her PCP.\\n\\nACTIVITY:\\nNo restrictions.\\n\\nDIET:\\nAs tolerated.\\n\\nALLERGIES:  HER MEDICATION ALLERGIES INCLUDE LATEX, DILAUDID, BENADRYL,\\nBACTRIM, AND KEFLEX.\\n\\n\\nHome Care was consulted, Institution Care.

The addendum is by Dr.\\nPerson80 with Dr. Person2.\\n\\nRIGHT BREAST RADIOACTIVE SEED LOCALIZED SEGMENTAL MASTECTOMY:\\nInvasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham grade 2. Focal ductal carcinoma\\nin situ, nuclear grade 2, solid type. No lymphovascular space\\ninvasion is identified. Inked margins of resection are negative for\\ninvasive and in situ carcinoma. Biopsy site changes. Invasive\\ncarcinoma cells are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptor\\nand negative for HER-2/neu by FISH analysis (as provided per previous\\npathology report).\\n\\nCOMMENTS:\\nThe patient is status post neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The fibrotic\\narea in the current specimen measuring 7.5 cm, which correlates with\\na prior radiologic impression (as per MRI from 05/24/2013). Invasive\\ntumor in the current specimen is present as small clusters of tumor\\ncells that spread over the entire fibrotic area. The percentage\\ncellularity compared to prior biopsy is 20%. Estimated primary tumor\\nvolume reduction is 80%. Inked margins of resection are negative for\\ninvasive and in situ carcinoma; invasive carcinoma is less than 1 mm\\nfrom the inked posterior margin.\\n\\nRIGHT SENTINEL LYMPH NODE NUMBER 1 BIOPSY:  One lymph node positive\\nfor metastatic carcinoma. The size of the metastasis measures 1.6 cm.\\nNo extracapsular extension is seen. No therapy related changes are\\npresent within the lymph node.\\n\\nRIGHT AXILLARY DISSECTION:  Nine lymph nodes negative for metastatic\\ncarcinoma.\\nAddendum Ends\\nCLINICAL HISTORY:\\nThis 62-year-old woman was diagnosed with grade 2 invasive ductal\\ncarcinoma with DCIS spring of 2013. By MR and also mammography this\\noccupied a span of about 7 cm. The more posterior aspect of this had\\nbeen biopsied under ultrasound guidance with a wing clip and the more\\nanterior aspect of this had been biopsied under MR guidance with a\\ncylinder clip placed. The patient then had primary chemotherapy with\\ngood response. Radioactive seed localization of the anterior and\\nposterior aspects of the known malignancy (at sites of clips) was\\nrequested prior to surgery today.\\n\\nPROCEDURES\\n\\n1.  Ultrasound right breast\\n2.  Ultrasound-guided radioactive seed placement right breast 9:00\\n3.  Mammographically guided radioactive seed placement right breast\\n8:00 anterior site\\n4.  Postprocedure digital mammogram right breast\\n5.  Specimen radiographs\\n\\nULTRASOUND AND ULTRASOUND GUIDED RADIOACTIVE SEED PLACEMENT RIGHT\\nBREAST\\n\\nThere are no clinically suspicious findings in the outer right\\nbreast. Initial ultrasound demonstrated in the 9 o'clock position\\nright breast about 10 cm from the nipple an irregular isoechoic 6 mm\\nmass with no posterior features, which is soft on elastography. This\\ncontains an echogenic clip. There are additional similar masses\\nextending antiradially inferiorly and at times I felt I could see the\\nechogenic clip which had been placed under MR guidance though I could\\nnot convincingly reproduce this and therefore performed the anterior\\nlocalization under mammographic guidance.\\n\\n\\nOperator: Dr. Person2\\n\\nProcedure was explained to the patient and informed consent was\\nobtained. Time out procedure was performed and laterality confirmed.\\nSterile technique was observed. The skin and subcutaneous tissues\\nwere infiltrated with 5 cc 1% Xylocaine. Using an 18-gauge needle,\\nunder direct sonographic visualization, a radioactive seed containing\\n0.098 mCi I-125 was placed into the lesion from a medial approach.\\nSeed placement position appeared optimal.\\n\\nThere were no immediate complications.\\n\\nMAMMOGRAPHICALLY GUIDED 125-I SEED PLACEMENT RIGHT BREAST.\\n\\nOperator:  Dr. Person2\\n\\nThe procedure was explained to the patient and informed consent was\\nobtained. Time out procedure was performed and laterality confirmed.\\nThe area of residual calcifications and clip were centered within the\\nalphanumeric grid from a lateral approach. Sterile technique was\\nobserved. The skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 5cc\\n1% lidocaine. An 18-gauge needle pre-loaded with a radioactive seed\\ncontaining  0.098 mCi I 125 was advanced to the area of interest and\\nposition confirmed. The seed was deployed and orthogonal mammogram\\nobtained. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate\\ncomplications.\\n\\nPost-procedure CC and ML mammograms confirm optimal seed positions\\nimmediately adjacent to the clips, spanning 6 cm. Images were\\nannotated.\\n\\nSPECIMEN RADIOGRAPHS\\nMultiple orthogonal specimen radiographs were obtained, initially\\nwith magnification and one was also obtained without magnification\\ndue to the large size of the specimen. Both the posterior wing clip\\nand seed and associated mass and the anterior cylinder clip and seed\\nare included within the specimen. There are some intervening\\ncalcifications and asymmetry. Results were telephoned to Dr. Person12\\nin the Operating Room.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\nSuccessful ultrasound-guided radioactive seed placement at the\\nposterior aspect of the known malignancy right breast 9:00 at site of\\nwing clip. Successful mammographically guided seed placement at the\\nanterior aspect of the known malignancy right breast 8:00 at site of\\ncylinder clip. Successful excision of the span of the known\\nmalignancy, and the 2 clips and 2 seeds.\\nDictated by:  Person4 Signed by:  Person4 Signed on: 04/02/2014 at 2:22 PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient40 is a 61 year old female with a recent diagnosis of right breast invasive ductal carcinoma that was estrogen receptor positive and HER-2 negative. The patient has undergone an ultrasound-guided an MRI guided biopsy of this area. Initially on ultrasound the tumor was thought to be about 2 cm. However, a subsequent MRI revealed that the tumor was actually 4.8 x 4.7 cm. The patient is here to discuss medical options prior to surgery. The patient is currently undecided between a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.\\nThe plan for Ms. Patient40 is to undergo CT scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and a bone scan to assess for any metastatic disease, and a MUGA scan to assess cardiac function.\\n\\nIt is recommended that the patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Adriamycin and Cytoxan x4 cycles followed by 12 cycles of weekly Taxol.\\n\\nThe patient will return to the clinic at the completion of her scans to begin her chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\nDictated by Person4, CRNP.\\nPatient40 is in agreement to proceed with this plan as stated.\\nTime spent face to face with the patient was 45 minutes, total counseling time was 40 minutes.\\nDuring that time, all of the patients questions were answered in detail.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Follow up\\nmammogram was recommended.\\n\\nTechnique:\\nBilateral digital diagnostic mammography with CAD. Breasts are\\npredominately composed of fat. Comparison is made to the studies of\\n2007 through 2013 . No suspicious finding is seen in the left breast.\\nThe previously noted ill-defined mass in the right upper outer\\nquadrant has markedly diminished and contains a wing biopsy clip. The\\ncylinder biopsy clip marking the MRI biopsy site more\\nanteroinferiorly in the right breast is present with no associated\\nmass. No suspicious calcifications are seen.\\n\\nRight breast ultrasound ultrasound of the lateral aspect of the right\\nbreast is compared to the sonogram of 03/19/2013. The previously\\nnoted ill-defined hypoechoic mass reported as being located at 8:00 6\\ncm from the nipple is now barely identifiable as 2 adjacent subtle\\nhypoechoic lesions each measuring about 4 mm. More caudally there is\\na very subtle mixed echogenicity area in the right lower outer\\nquadrant believed to represent the MRI biopsy site also about 4 mm in\\ndimension.\\n\\nImpression:\\nMarked diminution in the biopsy-proven carcinoma the right lateral\\nbreast at the site of ultrasound-guided core biopsy. MRI biopsy clip\\nmarks a second site of malignancy. These areas are very difficult to\\nvisualize sonographically and is likely that localization procedure\\nwill require mammographic guidance and at least 2 localizing devices.\\n\\nNo radiographic evidence of malignancy in the left breast.\\n\\nPatient was informed of the results\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nSurgical consultation is recommended.\\n\\nACR BI-RADS 6 (biopsy-proven malignancy)\\nDictated by:    Person4 Signed by:  Person4 Signed on: 02/27/2014 at 6:49 PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Port placement requested for chemotherapy..\\n\\nATTENDING PRESENCE:\\nDr. Person23, the attending radiologist, was present from the beginning\\nto the end of the procedure.\\n\\nSEDATION:\\nModerate sedation was used for the procedure. The sedation time was\\napproximately 50 minutes and was provided under direct supervision.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:\\nThe risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed and informed\\nconsent was obtained.  Prior to beginning the procedure, Universal\\nProtocol was used to confirm the patient's identity and planned\\nprocedure.  Fluoroscopy time has been recorded in the electronic\\nmedical record.\\n\\nPrior to the procedure, the central veins were evaluated by\\nultrasound, an image recorded and placed in the patient's chart.\\n\\nMaximum sterile barriers including cap, mask, hand hygiene, sterile\\ngloves, sterile gown, large sterile drape and 2% chlorhexidine for\\ncutaneous antisepsis were used.\\n\\nPort placement was elected on the left side, given the history of\\nright breast cancer. The skin over the left internal jugular vein was\\nsterilely prepped, draped and infiltrated with 1% buffered lidocaine.\\nThe vein was accessed with a 21G needle using realtime ultrasound\\nguidance.  A guidewire and catheter were then passed centrally using\\nfluoroscopic guidance.   The intravascular length from the access\\nsite to the right atrium was then measured.  After infiltrating the\\nskin in the subclavicular region with 1% buffered lidocaine, a short\\ntransverse incision was made and the pocket for the power injectable\\nport reservoir was formed by blunt dissection.\\n\\nThe catheter was tunneled to the IJ access site, cut to the\\nappropriate length and inserted through a peel-away sheath.  The\\ncatheter was flushed with 100U/ml heparin and the access needle was\\nleft in place.\\n\\nThe deep tissues were approximated using 4-0 Monocryl and the\\nincision closed using Dermabond.  The incision in the lower neck was\\nclosed in a similar fashion.\\n\\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:\\nLess than 30mL.\\n\\nDISCHARGED TO:\\nRecovery and then to chemoinfusion\\n\\nCONDITION:\\nStable\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\nUltrasound image shows a patent vein in the lower neck.  The final\\nfluoroscopic image demonstrates the catheter with its tip at the\\nright atrium.

Her breast cancer was diagnosed in 7/2012 - underwent right mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy (0/2) and prophylactic left mastectomy (per patient request - also had 0/7 axillary LN negative from left side) - 2 foci of IDC 2.2 cm and 0.5cm size, Nottingham score 7/9, nuclear grade 2, no LVSI, free surgical margins, extensive DCIS.\\n\\nCurrently she feels well except she is having problems with ongoing drainage from both of her bilateral chest wall drains. Additionally she has some erythema and tenderness around her right-sided drain; she is scheduled to see surgery later today.\\nShe denies associated fevers and chills and states that overall she feels that things are getting better not worse.\\n\\nOn July 09, 2012, a digital screening mammogram revealed asymmetry in the right breast.\\n On July 16, 2012, a right diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound revealed an irregular hypoechoic mass with some shadowing at the 2:00 region, measuring 2.6 cm. There was an additional hypoechoic shadowing mass at the 1:00 position, measuring 0.5 cm. This was suspicious for a satellite lesion. There were no abnormal right axillary lymph nodes.\\nOn July 20, 2012, an ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the right breast at the 1:00 position revealed invasive ductal carcinoma nuclear grade 2. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the right breast at the 2:00 position revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 2. The tumor was estrogen receptor positive with an H-score of 190 and progesterone receptor positive with an H-score of 5. Her tumor was HER-2/neu negative at 0. The Ki-67 was moderate at 20%.\\nOn July 31, 2012, a breast MRI revealed a spiculated enhancing mass in the anterior upper inner quadrant with several strands of clumped non-masslike enhancement extending superiorly, medially, and posteriorly. This was concerning for additional malignant involvement which is contained just with the second biopsy site in the posterior upper inner breast. No MRI evidence of left breast malignancy. No suspicious lymphadenopathy.\\nOn August 9, 2012, under the care of Dr. Person2, the patient underwent a right total mastectomy and right sentinel node biopsy and prophylactic left mastectomy. This revealed 2 foci of invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 2.2 cm and 0.5 cm at the 2:00 and 1:00 positions respectively. The nottingham score was 7/9 and nottingham grade 2. There was extensive DCIS for an extension of 4.7 cm. Her was no evidence of lymphovascular space involvement. All margins were free of tumor. There were 2 negative right sentinel nodes.

Discussed her risk for distant recurrence and the relative risk benefit with adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy. Will quantify her risk for recurrence with Oncotype testing. Patient willing to pursue this plan.\\n 2. She would definitely benefit from adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy (aromatase inhibitors). We will start the therapy after a plan is formulated with regards to chemotherapy. She will be obtaining a DEXA test (ordered by PCP). If osteopenic, she would benefit from being on calcium+Vit D and bisphosphonates for bone protection.\\n 3. No indication for adjuvant radiation therapy given tumor size of <4, node negative disease and mastectomy.\\n4. Return to clinic in 3 weeks time.\\n\\n Dictated by Person24, MD, for Person266, MD. Person266, MD examined the patient, outlined this plan of treatment.\\nPatient42 is in agreement to proceed with this plan as stated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I think that there is definitely still some fluid bilaterally. I have personally performed the medical decision making and note the following: Dr. Patient42 is understandably concerned about the toxicities as adjuvant chemotherapy given her age. However, despite the fact that she is 77, she is quite healthy and fully functional and is still actively teaching. We talked about the role of adjuvant medical therapy and breast cancer including both chemotherapy and adjuvant endocrine therapy. We discussed that the purpose is to treat endoscopic disease and lower the risk of a distant recurrence. I agree with her that we should way the decision about chemotherapy carefully. I will order an Oncotype test today she and she will come back in 3 weeks to go over the results.

I agree with history and physical examination findings. I have personally performed the medical decision making and note the following: Dr. Patient42 does endorse some very mild increase in her symptom with her left thumb which has a tendency toward trigger finger and very mild stiffness in her right knee. She thinks these symptoms might be slightly worse on Arimidex but overall she really has not had notable side effects on Arimidex that are limiting in her in any way. She is willing to continue. I discussed with her the importance of medication compliance and adherence to dosing. As documented in previous notes she decided against adjuvant chemotherapy given her age and the possibility of complications. I encouraged her to continue exercising and to limit alcohol intake. She will return to clinic in 3 months to tell us how she's doing on the Arimidex.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

I agree with history and physical examination findings. I noted the following additions, Dr. Patient42 is extremely anxious and agitated about her test results. On physical exam her wounds appear better healed than the last time I saw her. She still has significant fluid present however consistent with seroma in her chest wall. However it is less erythematous and does not appear overtly infected. I have personally performed the medical decision making and note the following: Dr. Person15 is a 77 yo woman with T2 N0 infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast. She is ER positive PR positive and HER-2 negative disease, but unfortunately her Oncotype score has come back at 31 which is right on the border between intermediate and high risk. This test score projects at 21% chance of developing metastatic breast cancer in the next 10 years on adjuvant endocrine therapy. I have talked with her husband in her for over 45 minutes today about these results. We reviewed that the test of systems that the patient is going to complete at least 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy. I have told her that overall, she still has early stage breast cancer, and that her prognosis is still good. We reviewed that even if she is taking adjuvant endocrine therapy she still has approximately a 20 the 100 chance of developing metastatic breast cancer, or breast cancer in the distant part of her body. We reviewed that should that happen, she would be considered incurable, but she would still be treatable for some period of time.\\n\\nAdditionally, her test results also indicate that unfortunately she may be more endocrine resistant than a lot of other women with ER-positive breast cancer. Therefore, she would actually probably get a substantial risk\\nreduction with adjuvant chemotherapy. I have estimated that for her to be approximately 5-7% absolute benefit. She is really unsure about whether she wants to take adjuvant chemotherapy. I discussed with her that my recommendation would be to attempt 4 cycles of Taxotere and Cytoxan with Neulasta support. Despite her advanced age, she works out regularly with her trainer and is teaching full time. Medically, she is at least 10 years younger than her stated age. I feel strongly that she has 10 years to live and is unlikely to die for other reasons in the next 10 years and that is why I have recommended chemotherapy. We did discuss however, the risks of chemotherapy that would be considered rare. Given her advanced age she could be at increased risk of infection or serious complications that could even become, in very unusual circumstances, life-threatening.\\n She very much desires that I discuss her treatment with her other physicians including her primary care doctor and Dr. Person16, from whom she is seeking second opinion.\\nI told her I will do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Her breast cancer was diagnosed in 7/2012 - underwent right mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy (0/2) and prophylactic left mastectomy (per patient request - also had 0/7 axillary LN negative from left side) - 2 foci of IDC 2.2 cm and 0.5cm size, Nottingham score 7/9, nuclear grade 2, no LVSI, free surgical margins, extensive DCIS.\\nOn July 09, 2012, a digital screening mammogram revealed asymmetry in the right breast.\\n On July 16, 2012, a right diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound revealed an irregular hypoechoic mass with some shadowing at the 2:00 region, measuring 2.6 cm. There was an additional hypoechoic shadowing mass at the 1:00 position, measuring 0.5 cm. This was suspicious for a satellite lesion. There were no abnormal right axillary lymph nodes.\\nOn July 20, 2012, an ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the right breast at the 1:00 position revealed invasive ductal carcinoma nuclear grade 2. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the right breast at the 2:00 position revealed invasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 2. The tumor was estrogen receptor positive with an H-score of 190 and progesterone receptor positive with an H-score of 5. Her tumor was HER-2/neu negative at 0. The Ki-67 was moderate at 20%.\\nOn July 31, 2012, a breast MRI revealed a spiculated enhancing mass in the anterior upper inner quadrant with several strands of clumped non-masslike enhancement extending superiorly, medially, and posteriorly. This was concerning for additional malignant involvement which is contained just with the second biopsy site in the posterior upper inner breast. No MRI evidence of left breast malignancy. No suspicious lymphadenopathy.\\nOn August 9, 2012, under the care of Dr. Person2, the patient underwent a right total mastectomy and right sentinel node biopsy and prophylactic left mastectomy. This revealed 2 foci of invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 2.2 cm and 0.5 cm at the 2:00 and 1:00 positions respectively. The nottingham score was 7/9 and nottingham grade 2. There was extensive DCIS for an extension of 4.7 cm. Her was no evidence of lymphovascular space involvement. All margins were free of tumor. There were 2 negative right sentinel nodes. The left breast revealed fibrocystic changes with focal lobular hyperplasia and sclerosing adenosis. Seven left axillary lymph nodes were negative for tumor.\\nAug 18th - visiting home nurse finds her right mastectomy site tender and inflamed - started on antibiotics for wound infection, per surgery. Will be seeing Dr. Person2 later today.\\n Patient reports that she just recently recovered from her concussion related neuro-cognitive symptoms.

Discussed her risk for distant recurrence and the relative risk benefit with adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy. Will quantify her risk for recurrence with Oncotype testing. Patient willing to pursue this plan.\\n 2. She would definitely benefit from adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy (aromatase inhibitors). We will start the therapy after a plan is formulated with regards to chemotherapy. She will be obtaining a DEXA test (ordered by PCP). If osteopenic, she would benefit from being on calcium+Vit D and bisphosphonates for bone protection.\\n 3. No indication for adjuvant radiation therapy given tumor size of <4, node negative disease and mastectomy.\\n4. Return to clinic in 3 weeks time.\\n\\n Dictated by Person24, MD, for Person266, MD.

Mild tricuspid regurgitation, trivial pericardial\\neffusion without electrographical signs of increased pericardial pressure and\\nimpaired relaxation consistent with stage diastolic dysfunction.\\n\\nAdditionally, the patient underwent an adenosine stress test October 27, 2009\\nthat was negative, clearing patient for discharge to home.\\n\\n1. Given the new finding of thoracic AAA, the patient will need to have a\\nfollowup CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with and without IV dye, for\\ncontinued surveillance of this new finding, in January, 2010 results being sent\\nto Dr. Person26, the patient's primary medical oncologist Dr. Person8 was\\nnotified of these findings via e-mail. Dr. Person8 will may decisions as to\\nwhether or not the patient will continue on current chemotherapy regimen.\\n\\n2. Oncology. History of breast cancer. The patient follows with Dr. [UUU\\nTTT], as previously stated; the patient's last chemotherapy regimen, on\\nOctober 22, 2009, at which point patient also received Neulasta. This resulted\\nin the patient's leukocytosis, which is currently trending down. The patient\\ncurrently is receiving Herceptin, Taxotere and carboplatin. It is uncertain as\\nto whether or not Dr. Person8 will change this regimen given the findings of\\ntriple a day.\\n\\n3. Prophylaxis. The patient has been on subcutaneous heparin which she has been\\nrefusing as she is ambulating well and Prilosec for her GI prophylaxis during\\nher stay.\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Fluids/electrolytes/nutrition.\\nThe patient has been on IV fluids having electrolytes repleted as necessary and\\ntolerating a regular diet when not n.p.o.\\n\\nDISPOSITION:\\n\\nThe patient is stable for discharge to home at this time with instructions to\\ndirect questions and concerns to her PCP or to Dr. Person26's the office.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:\\n\\nThe patient's home medications include _____ capsule by mouth daily and Ambien\\n5 mg by mouth at bedtime.\\n\\nNo new medications are being started for this patient at this time.\\n\\nThe patient to follow up with PCP in one week.

Heterogeneously dense fibroglandular\\ntissue is otherwise present in the left breast as before without\\nsignificant change with no evidence of any other spiculated mass\\norsuspicious calcifications. Ultrasound of the left axilla\\ndemonstrated a 1.1x0.9x0.5cm hypoechoic structure with echogenic rim\\nwith echogenicity in the center which was vascular. This may\\nrepresent a treated lymph node, however residual malignancy cannot be\\nexcluded. Remainder of the left axilla failed to demonstrate any\\nother abnormal lymph node.\\n\\nRIGHT BREAST: An asymmetric density in the superior aspect of the\\nright breast seen only on the MLO view which was demonstrated to\\nrepresent superimposed breast tissue is again seen unchanged. This\\ndensity is even less apparent on the CC view when compared to\\nprevious mammogram. Heterogeneously dense fibroglandular tissue is\\notherwise present as before.

She also had\\nbiopsy proven metastatic disease to the left axilla. She is status\\npost 6 treatments of chemotherapy. She presents to Institution today for bilateral breast MRI to assess the disease\\nresponse to chemotherapy. She has not had surgical excision of her\\nindex tumor at this point.\\n\\nTECHNIQUE:\\nBreast MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla GE EXCITE scanner.  Axial\\nSTIR images were obtained through both breasts. T1-weighted sagittal\\nand axial VIBRANT images were then obtained prior to contrast\\nadministration. This was followed by 4 multiphase axial VIBRANT\\nT1-weighted sequences after the intravenous administration of\\n0.1mmol/kg body weight gadolinium.  Images were obtained at 75-second\\nintervals, beginning at 90-second post intravenous contrast\\nadministration. Delayed sagittal post-contrast VIBRANT T1-weighted\\nimages were obtained through both breasts. CAD-stream post-processing\\nwas performed, including subtraction images and multiplane\\nreconstructions.  14cc of ProHance contrast was utilized for this\\nexamination.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\nThe multiplanar, multisequential examination of the bilateral breasts\\ndemonstrates a moderate amount of background benign physiologic\\nenhancement.\\n\\nWithin the left breast, there are no foci of suspicious or abnormal\\nenhancement seen throughout the breast, specifically in the 4 o'clock\\nposition where a biopsy clip demarcates the index tumor. A few\\nnonspecific foci of benign-type, subthreshold in enhancement are\\npresent in the posterior left breast and demonstrate corresponding\\nincreased T2 signal representing benign disease.\\n\\nThe previously described left intramammary lymph node in the\\nposterior left breast as well as the large left axillary lymph nodes\\nhave decreased in size and conspicuity. The left nipple areolar\\ncomplex and the left pectoral muscle remains normal in signal\\nintensity and enhancement characteristics.\\n\\nThere are no foci of suspicious enhancement or architectural\\ndistortion in the right breast. The right nipple areolar complex, the\\nright axilla and the right pectoral muscle demonstrate normal signal\\nintensity and enhancement characteristics.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n1. THE INDEX TUMOR IN THE 4 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE LEFT BREAST NO\\nLONGER DEMONSTRATES SIGNIFICANT GADOLINIUM ENHANCEMENT.\\n2. THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED LEFT INTRAMAMMARY LYMPH NODE AND THE LEFT\\nAXILLARY LYMPH NODES HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN SIZE AND ARE NO\\nLONGER PATHOLOGICALLY ENLARGED.\\n3. THERE IS NO MRI EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY IN THE RIGHT BREAST.\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS\\nACR BI-RADS CATEGORY:\\n6: (BREAST IMAGING BILATERAL) KNOWN BIOPSY PROVEN MALIGNANCY\\nRECOMMENDATION:CONTINUED SURGICAL EVALUATION IS RECOMMENDED FOR\\nBIOPSY PROVEN CARCINOMA IN THE LEFT 4 O'CLOCK BREAST WITH METASTATIC\\nDISEASE TO THE LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODES.\\n\\nOVERALL ASSESSMENT:  6  KNOWN BIOPSY PROVEN MALIGNANCY\\n\\nEND OF IMPRESSION:\\nDictated by:  Person4 Signed by:  Person4 Signed on: 01/15/2010 at 5:22 PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

We\\ncultured\\nher up and drew all her bloods from her right anterior chest port, and\\nwe\\ndid get a preliminary 24-hour blood culture report stating no growth.\\n Unfortunately,\\nshe spiked a fever today, up to about 104 at home by her\\naccount.\\nShe took one 500 mg Tylenol tablet, and by the time she got here,\\ntemperature\\nwas 99 degrees. The patient feels fine at this time. She is not\\nhaving\\nany chills and has not had all along any URI symptoms, any UTI symptoms,\\nany\\ncough, or anything like that now. She and her husband did go on a cruise\\nand\\ncame home last week. Husband immediately got a head cold symptom, which\\ntook\\nhim about a week to clear up. The patient's suspects that she may have\\ngotten\\nsick from that exposure. I did speak with Dr. Person2, her oncologist,\\nearlier\\ntoday who asked if we could get another dedicated blood culture from\\nthe\\nport site itself which we drew. However, I do not think that there is\\nanything\\nthat we need to do at this time further. She is currently on her last\\ndose\\nof 1-week course of Avelox that she received last week. Yesterday, she\\nhad\\na negative chest x-ray, negative urinalysis, and blood work that looked\\ngood\\nincluding a negative 24-hour preliminary blood culture report again from\\nblood\\ndrawn from her port that she assures us was indeed from the port, not a\\nperipheral\\nline. I cannot really make heads or tails out of her CBC from\\nyesterday\\nbecause she recently received a Neulasta shot. Her white count was\\n15,000\\nyesterday with 22% bands. I am not going to re-draw CBC today, but I\\nwill\\ndraw the port.\\n\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for the breast cancer along with elevated\\ncholesterol,\\nhysterectomy, heart murmur, scoliosis, tubal ligation, and dental\\nextraction.\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN, VICODIN, AND SULFA DRUGS.\\n\\n\\nMEDICATIONS: Tylenol, Lopid, Kytril, Avelox along with her chemotherapy\\nregimen.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY: She is not a smoker.\\n\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: General: Positive for fever.

She sought medical attention in April 2010 and underwent a\\nsegmental\\nmastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy of the left breast on May\\n26,\\n2010. Her final pathology was consistent with stage 1, T1c, N0, M0 invasive\\nductal\\ncarcinoma, Nottingham score 6/9, highly ER-positive, PR-positive,\\nHER-2/neu\\nand FISH-negative. The patient was found to have a 1.7 cm mass with\\nDCIS\\nhigh-grade ________ with comedo necrosis. Fortunately, her sentinel lymph\\nnode\\nwas negative. She underwent an Oncotype DX testing which the score was\\nconsistent\\nwith intermediate risk of 19. The patient was offered participation\\nin\\nTAILORx trial; however, the patient decided to get treatment off study,\\nadjuvant\\nchemotherapy with Taxotere and cyclophosphamide.\\n\\n\\n The plan was to give a total of four cycles of Taxotere and cyclophosphamide\\nand\\nher fourth cycle was given on October 13. Yesterday night, the patient\\nstarted\\nhaving fever for almost one day with minimal cough. The patient\\ncontinued\\nto have generalized weakness. Yesterday night, the patient spiked to\\n104\\nwith chills; hence, the patient's husband called my office and I advised\\nthis\\npatient to come to the ED.\\n\\n\\n In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have fever of 103.7. Her\\npulse\\nwas 109 and saturating 92% room air. The patient underwent a chest x-ray\\nwhich\\nrevealed a patchy airspace opacity in the right middle lobe suspicious\\nfor\\npneumonia; however, the film was a little rotated at times. The patient\\nunderwent\\nblood work testing which was consistent with neutropenia with a total\\nwhite\\ncount of 0.6, hemoglobin of 10.1 with a platelet count of 207. She was\\nnoted\\nto have monocytes of 56% with absolute neutrophil count of 80. Hence the\\npatient\\nwas admitted for the workup of neutropenic fever. She was given\\ncefepime\\nin the ED.\\n\\n\\nAt present, the patient is tired and weak and tearful at times; however, denies\\nany\\nfevers or chills or chest pain or shortness of breath at this time. No\\nnausea,\\nvomiting, no diarrhea, no dysuria, no headache, no double vision, no\\nblurry\\nvision, no hemoptysis, no hematemesis and no hematuria.\\n\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: All other review of systems were assessed and reported\\nnegative;\\nas mentioned above otherwise.\\n*U*P*M*C*\\nPatient38#:\\n\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes:  1. Scoliosis.\\n2.\\nHeart murmur.\\n\\n\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1. Status post tubal ligation.\\n2.\\nPartial hysterectomy.\\n3.\\nTendon repair.\\n4.\\nSegmental mastectomy, as mentioned above.\\n\\n\\nMEDICATIONS: Current medications are nausea pills. She was on gemfibrozil and\\nmultivitamin\\nin the past; however, has been off and on since the chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n ALLERGIES: PENICILLIN CAUSES SWELLING AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH. VICODIN CAUSES\\nHALLUCINATIONS.\\nTHE PATIENT HAS TOLERATED CEFEPIME VERY WELL.\\n\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives with her husband. She used to\\nwork\\nin an accounting business. She denies any alcohol, recreational drugs or\\ntobacco\\nuse.\\n\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY: Father with a history of prostate cancer in the 70s. Mother\\ndied\\nat the age of 84 with heart disease. One paternal aunt had breast cancer\\nin\\nlater 60s.\\nPHYSICAL\\nEXAMINATION:  GENERAL: A well-built, well-nourished female for her stated age.\\n\\n\\nVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure of 95/56, heart rate of 77, respirations 18 and\\nsaturating\\n98% on room air. Temperature: T-spike in the last 24 hours was\\n103.7.\\nHer ECOG performance status is 0.\\n\\n\\nHEENT: Atraumatic and normocephalic. Pupils are equal and reactive to light and\\naccommodation.\\nNares are clear.

ANC of 80 with a total\\nwhite\\ncount of 0.6, hemoglobin 10.1 and platelet count of 207.\\n\\n\\n Her sodium is 137, potassium 3.7, chloride 102, bicarb 27, BUN 9 and creatinine\\n0.9\\nwith a glucose of 132.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHer blood culture has been sent from the ED, as well as from the port which is\\nnegative\\nfor 24 hours this morning.\\n\\n\\n Urine culture is pending.\\n\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN: In summary, Ms. Patient38 is a 63-year-old Caucasian female\\nwho\\nis diagnosed with a stage 1, T1c, N0, M0, ER/PR-positive, HER-2/neu\\nnegative,\\nand HER2 FISH-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left\\nbreast\\ndiagnosed in April 2010, status post adjuvant chemotherapy, TC times\\nfour\\ncycles (last cycle finished on October 13), who presents for neutropenic\\nfever.\\n\\n\\n 1. ID: The only obvious source at this time is the chest x-ray suspicious for\\nright\\npneumonia. I agree. The patient has been covered with broad-spectrum\\nantibiotics\\nwith cefepime. Dr. Person16 from Infectious Disease has been\\nconsulted.\\nWe will await his opinion. In the meantime, we will continue to\\ncover\\nher with the broad-spectrum antibiotic. There is no sign of port\\ntenderness;\\nhence, it is safe to avoid vancomycin at this time. However, if she\\nspikes,\\nthen consideration to be given to switch to either Zosyn or meropenem\\nplus\\nvancomycin. However, we will leave it up to the Infectious Disease's\\ninput.\\nHer ANC is 80; hence, I have started Neupogen 300 mg daily to be\\ncontinued\\ntill her ANC is greater than 1500. The patient is already on\\nneutropenic\\nprecautions.\\n\\n\\n2. DISPOSITION: The patient's disposition will be planned once her blood\\ncultures\\nare negative and her ANC is greater than 500 and she is afebrile for\\nat\\nleast 24 to 48 hours.\\n\\n\\n\\n This was discussed with the patient at the bedside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___________________________________\\nAuthenticated\\nelectronically at end of document\\n\\n\\nDictator: Person25, M.D.\\nDM/klf\\n\\nD: 10/24/2010 12:32:35\\nT:  10/24/2010 15:08:13\\nR:  10/25/2010 12:43:15/eab\\n//\\n\\n\\n CC:  Authenticated by Min Person32, MD On 11/02/2010 08:38:26 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Potential\\nrisks including bleeding and infection were discussed. The patient\\nbrought to the Angiography Suite and placed supine on the angiography\\ntable. The right neck and chest were prepped and draped in the usual\\nsterile fashion. The right neck was interrogated with ultrasound and\\na widely patent right internal jugular vein was identified. An image\\ndocumenting the patency of the internal jugular vein was saved and\\narchived. The skin and subcutaneous soft tissues were anesthetized\\nwith 1% Bupivacaine. Using ultrasound guidance and micropuncture\\ntechnique the internal jugular vein was accessed and a 5-French\\ntransitional dilator was placed. A 0.035 wire was advanced through\\nthe transitional dilator and into the inferior vena cava.\\n\\nAttention was then directed towards creation of a port pocket. The\\nskin overlying the right anterior chest was anesthetized with 2%\\nLidocaine. The deep soft tissues were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine\\nwith Epinephrine. Using a 15 blade, a 3-4 cm incision was made over\\nthe right anterior chest. Using blunt dissection, a port pocket was\\ncreated. An 8-French single lumen CT injectable Person8 port was\\nassembled. Using a tunneling device, the catheter was tunneled under\\nthe skin and pulled through the neck dermatotomy. The port was placed\\nin the port pocket and sutured to the chest wall with a single 2-0\\nSurgipro suture.\\n\\nAn 8.5-French peel away sheath was advanced over the wire into the\\ninternal jugular vein.The catheter was cut to an appropriate length.\\nDuring suspended respiration and using fluoroscopic guidance, the\\ncatheter was advanced through the peel away sheath and into the\\ncentral circulation. A fluoroscopic image documenting the tip of the\\ncatheter at the cavoatrial junction was saved and archived.\\n\\nPort incision was closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture followed\\nbyrunning 4-0 subcuticular suture. The neck dermatotomy was closed\\nwith a single 4-0 subcuticular Vicryl suture. Skin glue and\\nSteri-Strips were placed at both the port incision and neck\\ndermatotomy.\\n\\nI was present and scrubbed during the entire procedure and performed\\nthe entire procedure. Deep conscious sedation was administered by the\\nAnesthesia Service.\\n\\nFINDINGS:\\nPatent right internal jugular vein by ultrasound.\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the procedure, an 8-French single lumen CT\\ninjectable Person8 port entered via the right internal jugular vein\\nwith the tip at the cavoatrial junction.\\n\\nIncidentally noted was a severe scoliosis of the thoracic spine.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\nIMAGE GUIDED PLACEMENT OF 8-FRENCH SINGLE LUMEN CT INJECTABLE RIGHT\\nINTERNAL JUGULAR Person8 PORT.\\n\\nEND OF IMPRESSION:\\nDictated by:    Person4 Signed by:  Person4 Signed on: 08/10/2010 at 9:38 PM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Findings will be communicated by shared medical record.\\n\\n\\n\\n HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a very pleasant 63-year-old female who presented to the\\nEmergency\\nDepartment yesterday evening with fevers up to 104. She had received\\nher\\nlast dose of chemotherapy on 10/13/2010. She is currently receiving\\nTaxotere\\nand Cytoxan, which this was her fourth cycle. She had been previously\\nreceiving\\nNeulasta with good response. She did not receive Neulasta, this last\\ngo\\nround and developed fevers at home. She had been last febrile earlier in\\nOctober\\nafter receiving a dose of chemotherapy and going on a cruise with her\\nhusband.\\nShe was not hospitalized at that time. Blood cultures at that time\\nwere\\ndrawn and were negative and she was not quite so symptomatic. She is\\ncurrently\\nin 6B in no acute distress. She is sitting out of bed in a chair\\nwrapped\\nin blankets. MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE was 103.7 last night. She has\\ndefervesced\\nrather nicely today, although she is taking Tylenol and Motrin\\npretty\\nmuch around the clock. She had been taking Avelox earlier in October for\\ntreatment\\nof cold symptoms and was having some tenderness of the site of her\\nport\\nat her clavicle where she has a small bump.\\n\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Past medical history of this patient includes breast cancer. It was an\\ninfiltrating\\nductal cancer and some scoliosis.\\n\\n\\n PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\\nHysterectomy, tubal ligation, dental extractions, port placement over the\\nsummer\\nand a segmental mastectomy in May.\\n\\n\\n SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married. She is not employed outside the home at the present time, but\\nshe\\nsays she is extremely active in her church. She has no use of drugs,\\ntobacco\\nor alcohol reported.\\n\\n\\n *U*P*M*C* Patient38#:\\nREVIEW\\nOF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems reveals a pale African-American female sitting out of bed\\ncurrently\\nin no acute distress. She has been having fevers this admission, but\\nno\\nrigors at this present time. She did have some rigors at home. She is not\\ncomplaining\\nof nausea, although she states sometimes food just sort of sits in\\nher\\nstomach. She has to pace herself, and she eats small meals frequently\\nquite\\nslowly without any problems with regurgitation. She denies heartburn. She\\nhas\\nno chest pain with the exception of some discomfort at her upper clavicle.\\nIt\\nis way above the port. The port itself is nontender. She has subjective\\nshortness\\nof breath.\\n Her\\nabdomen is soft. She denies any clubbing, edema, or cyanosis of her lower\\nextremities,\\nand I can feel no cords.\\n\\n\\n LABORATORY DATA:  Reveal some significant neutropenia. Last count was 15 on 10/03/2010; it is\\ndown\\n0.6 after her last blast of chemo. She is anemic currently at 8.8. She\\ndoes\\nnot have a bandemia. She has eosinophils of 10 with an absolute neutrophil\\ncount\\nof 0.08. She does not have a PT/INR ordered. Her urinalysis is 6 to 20\\nwhite\\ncells. Blood cultures from the 10/22 are no growth, one from the port and\\none\\nfrom the periphery.\\n\\n\\n PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT: Pupils are small, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.\\nSclerae\\nare pale and anicteric. Oral mucosa is pink and moist without any\\nevidence\\nof thrush. He has no anterior cervical lymphadenopathy.\\nCHEST: Chest some hyperaerated breath sounds posteriorly, with a few crackles\\nin\\nbases subjectively.\\n\\n\\n CARDIAC: Rate and rhythm are regular without rubs, or clicks. She has a soft\\nmitral\\nregurgitation murmur almost negligible only could be heard in a silent,\\nsilent\\nroom.\\n\\n\\nABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. Bowel sounds are active.\\n\\n\\n EXTREMITIES: Lower extremities reveal no clubbing, edema, or cyanosis. Distal\\npulses\\nare intact and palpable.\\n\\n\\n CLINICAL IMPRESSION:  I agree with neutropenic fever; however, her exacerbation of symptoms with\\nAvelox\\nis worrisome for a pulmonary embolus with palpitations and shortness of\\nbreath\\nwithout any evidence of rash. This had been the third course of Avelox\\nshe\\nhad been taking and had never had any issues with it before.\\n\\n\\n She had a CT of the chest done in August 2010 and we will at least have that\\nfor\\ncomparison. She has no evidence of renal impairment and I did discuss this\\nwith\\nDr. Person16 regarding obtaining a CT of the chest.\\n\\n\\n I will discuss antibiotic management with Dr. Person15 who will independently\\nevaluate\\nthe patient.

She reported some low-grade fever and chills, and because\\nshe\\nis currently on chemotherapy for breast cancer, she was following Oncology\\ninstructions\\nto be seen with a fever. The patient does not have any sore\\nthroat,\\nearache, UTI, or URI symptoms. There is on belly pain. She has no\\ndiarrhea.\\nShe is not throwing up. She is currently on or about her third\\nround\\nof chemotherapy with a 4-round regimen planned for treatment of her\\nbreast\\ncancer. The patient received a Neulasta shot last week.\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  On exam, I find no evidence of acute infection anywhere.\\nLUNGS:  Clear.\\nABDOMEN:  Her belly is soft and nontender.\\nHEENT:  Her throat and her ears look fine.\\nSKIN:  Does not have any rashes or areas of what looks like cellulitis.\\n\\n\\nChest x-ray is negative per my interpretation. Her blood work showed\\nessentially\\nnormal BMP except to suggest she might be dry with a BUN of 6. Her\\nCBC\\nshowed a white count of 15, her H and H were 10.6 and 31.1, platelets are\\n149,000.\\nDifferential includes 67% neutrophils and 22% bands but again, she\\nhad\\na Neulasta shot last week. Urine was clean. Chest x-ray is negative per\\nmy\\ninterpretation. She does have a tunneled catheter in her chest. Dr. Person2\\nhad\\nactually put her on some Avelox earlier in the week. She has no pain\\naround\\nthe tunneled catheter. No redness. My suspicion is that she has picked\\nup\\na viral infection. This seems to be a little bit more likely as well since\\nshe\\nand her husband went on a cruise last week, and the day after they\\nreturned,\\nher husband got a head cold which he is now finally getting over 1\\nweek\\nlater. I spoke with Dr. Person12. Since she is hemodynamically stable\\nand\\ncomfortable and really afebrile at\\n\\n\\n this time without any shakes or chills, and her temperature is 97.6, we will\\nlet\\nher go home to follow up as needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n ___________________________________\\nAuthenticated\\nelectronically at end of document\\n\\n\\nDictator: Person13, D.O.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nD: 10/03/2010 12:16:55\\n*U*P*M*C*\\nPatient38#:\\nT:  10/03/2010 17:47:07\\nR:  10/03/2010 17:47:07/jkj\\n//\\n\\n\\n CC:  Authenticated by Person13, DO On 10/07/2010 10:14:55 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Left modified radical mastectomy, February 2012, showing multifocal invasive lobular cancer, Nottingham score 7 of 9, with tumor sizes ranging from 0.7 to 1.1 cm, with the aggregate tumor size 2.5 cm.\\nThere was LCIS.\\nThere was lymphovascular space involvement.\\nSurgical margins were clean.\\nThree positive axillary nodes out of 13 reviewed.\\n 2. I recommended to her the HER-2 low clinical trial of chemotherapy with or without Herceptin for HER-2 of 1+.\\nShe declined.\\nTherefore, I am treating her with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with Taxotere and Cytoxan for a total of 6 cycles.\\nShe presents for cycle 5 today.\\n\\n INTERIM HISTORY:  She felt extremely fatigued for about 5 or 6 days during this last treatment cycle.\\nShe denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation.\\nJoint pain is not much of a problem lately.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Performance status 1.\\nVital signs recorded.\\nSKIN:  Normal.\\nHEENT:  No jaundice.\\nLYMPH NODES:  None palpable.\\nLUNGS:  Clear.\\nHEART:  Regular.\\nBREASTS:  Left mastectomy.\\nNo subcutaneous nodules.\\nRight breast, no mass.\\nABDOMEN:  Normal.\\nEXTREMITIES:  Normal.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL:  Normal.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:  1.

She has tested negative for BRCA1 or 2 mutation.\\n\\n PLAN:  1. Cycle 5 TC today.\\n 2. She will cut back a little bit on the duration of Decadron down to\\nabout 4 days total, and hopefully this will combat the myalgias and arthralgias that she feels with the Taxotere.\\n 3. I am going to refer her for a consideration of postmastectomy radiation.\\nShe wants to be seen in Institution Radiation Oncology, and I will therefore refer her to Dr. Person27.\\nShe does have 3 positive nodes, and it is an infiltrating lobular multifocal, and I think this merits strong consideration of postmastectomy radiation.\\nI will refer her to Dr. Person12 after the 6th cycle of adjuvant TC, which will be in 3 weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\n _________________________\\n\\nPerson13, MD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n D: 06/25/2012 06:23 PM (EST)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT: 06/26/2012 09:13 AM (EST)\\nDJN: \\nSJN: \\n572801\\n\\n\\ncc: Person27, MD\\nInstitution Radiation Oncology\\n\\nMark Person16, MD\\n1000 Medical Arts Bldg., \\n\\nLocation, PA \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Patient now requires tunneled central venous\\ncatheter and subcutaneous port placement for long-term IV\\nchemotherapy administration.\\n\\nPROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:\\nPerson210, M.D., was present in the Interventional Suite\\nthroughout the entire procedure and performed the entire procedure.\\nNo intravenous contrast was used.\\n\\nAfter informed consent, and administration of IV antibiotics (Ancef\\n1g IV), and initiation of IV moderate sedation, the right neck and\\nchest were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Following\\nachievement of local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, a\\nsmall incision was made overlying the right internal jugular vein.\\nThen, using ultrasound guidance, the right internal jugular vein was\\naccessed using a 21-gauge micropuncture needle, after confirming\\npatency and demonstrating needle position, ultrasound images were\\nsaved. A 0.018-inch guidewire advanced central, terminating at the\\nlevel of the cavo-atrial junction.\\n\\nNext, the subcutaneous tissues overlying the right anterior chest\\nwall were anesthetized with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine and a port\\npocket was created using both blunt and sharp dissection. Then, using\\na metal tunneling device, a the 5-French single lumen Power PAC\\ncentral venous catheter was tunneled from the pocket site to the\\naccess site, trimmed to an appropriate length of approximately 19cm,\\nconnected to the T2 Power PAC port reservoir, which was placed within\\nthe port pocket and the catheter was then introduced into the central\\ncirculation using the usual exchanges of guidewires, dilators and a\\npeel-away sheath.\\n\\nThe port pocket was closed using 4-0 Polysorb interrupted and running\\nsubcutaneous sutures. The skin was closed using a running 5-0\\nPolysorb subcuticular suture and Steri-Strips. Dermabond glue was\\nused to close the incision site.\\n\\nThe port easily flushed with normal saline and was loaded with an\\nappropriate of heparinized saline after being accessed using a\\n19-gauge Person64 needle. Sterile dressings were applied to both sites.\\n\\nFinal digital supine image of the chest demonstrates the catheter tip\\nto end at the level of the cavo-atrial junction and the port\\nreservoir to be appropriately located over the right anterior chest\\nwall.\\n\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. No immediate complications\\nwere encountered. Administration, monitoring and documentation of IV\\nmoderate sedation using Versed 2mg IV and fentanyl 100mcg IV was\\nperformed during this procedure by the IR conscious sedation trained\\nnursing staff under the supervision of Dr. Person24 beginning at 0930\\nhours and completed at 1035 hours.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\nRight internal jugular vein port placement.\\n\\nEND OF IMPRESSION:\\nDictated by:    Person4 Signed by:  Person4 Signed on: 04/19/2012 at 09:11 AM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

She presented on 02/19/2002 following approximately ten days of\\na non-productive cough and chest pain.  She was diagnosed with pneumonia and\\nstared on _____ and Biaxin, and sent home from the emergency department that\\nday.  She again presented on 02/14/2002 with increased shortness of breath and\\nwent to the emergency department again.  She got a CT scan, which was negative\\nfor a PE and diagnosed again with pneumonia, and then changed to Tequin and\\nnebulizer treatments.  On 02/17/2002, she again went to the emergency\\ndepartment and diagnosed again with a left lower lobe pneumonia and started on\\nLevaquin, Ventolin and Tessalon Perles.  On the day of admission, she was\\nhaving dyspnea even at rest without any fevers, chills, night sweats or other\\nsymptoms.\\n\\nEchocardiogram revealed severe decrease in global functioning, global\\nhypokinesis and an ejection fraction of roughly 15% with a small posterior\\npericardial effusion.  She had moderate mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid\\nregurgitation.  She then developed rapid atrial fibrillation with\\ndecompensation and progression of her congestive heart failure.  She was\\nstarted on atrial natriuretic peptide (nesiritide) to induce diuresis in light\\nof her marginal blood pressure.  She was put on an Amiodarone drip and Digoxin\\nwith dramatic improvement in her shortness of breath, and subsequent conversion\\nto a normal sinus rhythm.\\n\\nCardiac catheterization revealed global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction\\nof 20% and no significant coronary artery disease.

DIARRHEA.\\n\\nCONSULTS\\nDr. Person48 and Dr. Person8.\\n\\nBRIEF HISTORY\\nThis patient is a 54-year-old white female with a history of breast cancer,\\nstatus post chemotherapy about ten days prior to admission, who presented to\\nthe emergency room on 07/07/2001 complaining of significant left leg swelling.\\nShe noted pain in her left groin four days prior to admission and began to feel\\ndizzy on standing two days prior to admission.  She came to the emergency room\\nbecause of the swelling and she denied any smoking history or shortness of\\nbreath, palpitations, fever, sweats.  The patient, of note, had been on\\nTamoxifen.  On initial physical exam the patient had a temperature of 100.6 and\\na large swollen left leg, both calf and thigh.  She was thus admitted for the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of the swelling.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE\\nThe patient had a Doppler of her left lower extremity which showed DVT of the\\nleft common femoral, superficial femoral and greater saphenous vein which was\\nquite large.  She was initially in the ICU.  She was seen by Dr. Person48 of\\nvascular, who recommended Trendelenburg, heparin bolus with drip and Coumadin.\\nDr. Person8 of hematology also saw the patient who agreed with the above\\nrecommendations.  He ordered a hypercoagulability profile looking for factor V\\nand the lupus anticoagulant and Tamoxifen was stopped.  Because the patient had\\na fever and also was found to be neutropenic, she was started on broad spectrum\\nantibiotics and was given neutropenic precautions.\\n\\nThe patient was kept on heparin for a total of five days and was started on\\nCoumadin, of which her INR came back too high, so this has been held for the\\nlast couple of days.  She also was hypocalcemic.  This was replaced and today\\nshe is still a bit lightheaded.  The patient also developed diarrhea for which\\na C. diff was done and she started vancomycin.  The vancomycin will be\\ncontinued for a total of seven days.  The C. diff toxin has come back negative.\\nLactose was stopped and it is going to be restarted after the diarrhea has\\ncompletely resolved for 24 hours.  The diarrhea has significantly decreased at\\nthis time.  The patient's broad spectrum antibiotics were cefepime.  These can\\nbe stopped as the blood cultures are negative after the final results are noted\\nhere.  Urine culture is negative also.  Today's white count was 2000 with a\\nneutrophil count over 500.  The patient will be continued on Coumadin for at\\nleast six months depending on her hypercoag profile.  Home care will be seeing\\nher to draw protimes and she is ambulating, albeit slowly  now.  The patient\\nreceived Leukine in the hospital and gets Procrit as an outpatient. She should\\nsee Dr. Person8 and Dr. Person24 in two weeks.\\n\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS\\n1.  Celexa 20 mg p.o. q. day.\\n2.  Levothroid 25 mcg p.o. q. day.\\n3.  Vancomycin 125 mg p.o. q.i.d. for three days.\\n4.  Procrit on Fridays.\\n5.  Imodium p.r.n.\\n6.  Coumadin as directed.\\n\\nDIET\\nAgain, she can resume lactose after the diarrhea resolves for greater than 24\\nhours and then she will be drinking Carnation Instant Breakfast b.i.d. with her\\nmeals.  Her albumin was quite low here.\\n\\nPHYSICAL ACTIVITY\\nThe patient should be wearing her Jobst stockings, but is able to resume normal\\nactivity.\\n\\nFOLLOW-UP:\\nShe should be seen by Drs. Person24 and Person8 in two weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\nPerson234, M.D.\\n\\nDict:       07/13/2001\\nTrans:      07/16/2001  3:00 P\\nsol/003091/119675\\n\\ncc:   Person21, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

She is a 56 year old caucasian postmenopausal woman who presents in office today to discuss management of the above referenced chief complaint. Patient underwent routine mammographic screening with the identification of a mass lesion in the retro glandular medial right breast. Subsequent diagnostic evaluation was performed and described below. This led to the performance of targeted large needle core biopsy under ultrasound guidance with pathology demonstrating a high-grade invasive ductal carcinoma, estrogen and progesterone receptor negative, HER-2 non-overexpressing, with a very high proliferative rate.\\n\\nPatient is entirely asymptomatic.

The breasts are symmetric in appearance. The nipples are everted without discharge or crusting. The skin is without secondary signs of malignancy to include erythema, edema, or retraction.\\n\\nRight Breast: Palpation negative for focal mass or asymmetry. She has a cutaneous mole in the medial right breast which is concerning, and for which excision is clearly necessary. No axillary, infra, or supraclavicular adenopathy.\\n\\nLeft Breast: Palpation negative for focal mass or asymmetry. No axillary, infra, or supraclavicular adenopathy.\\n\\nIMAGING REVIEW:  The patients Institution of Institution diagnostic breast imaging to include mammogram and ultrasound is independently reviewed along with the reports and I agree with the radiographic interpretations.\\n\\n The breasts are symmetrical with heterogeneously dense breast tissue. A benign-appearing lymph node is stable in the superior left breast. There is a new mass lesion in the posterior right breast medially which by ultrasound corresponds to an 11 mm hypoechoic solid mass. The lesion appears to be unicentric. There is no associated enlargement of right axillary lymph nodes.\\nThe percutaneous biopsy performed under ultrasound guidance is felt to be technically satisfactory and the clip deposited at the time of biopsy is is noted to have migrated 4 mm.\\n\\nAssessment:  Patient12 is a 56 year old\\npostmenopausal woman who presents with a screen detected malignant lesion of the right breast at the 3 o\\'clock position. She is clinically and radiographically node negative. The natural history of triple negative breast malignancy was reviewed with the patient and her husband. The combination of her family history and tumor type lead me to believe that there is a strong possibility of genetic predisposition. She has therefore been referred to the genetic counselors for testing with the idea that the result would influence our decision is for local therapy.\\n\\nShe clearly will require multimodality treatment based on the size and phenotype of her primary breast malignancy. I am referring her to medical oncology for consideration of upfront systemic therapy. While preoperative treatment is not necessary to successfully accomplished breast conserving surgery, it affords her at the time to undergo genetic testing and decreases her likelihood of proven to be node positive and therefore requiring axillary lymph node dissection.\\n\\nThe patient will undergo staging to rule out metastatic disease. She will be followed by our practice during the course of chemotherapy to monitor response, review the results of her genetic testing, and plan appropriate local interventions.\\n\\nThe patient demonstrates a satisfactory understanding of the situation, and wants to receive her care as part of the Institution of Institution Breast Cancer Program.\\n\\nCLINICAL STAGE: Stage I IDC grade 3(T1c N0 M0) ER 0 PR 0 HER-2 negative Ki-67 90%\\n\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  1: Referral to medical oncology\\n2: Referral to cancer genetics\\n3: Return to clinic at the midportion of systemic therapy to review\\nresults and discuss local treatment options\\n4: Referral to her dermatologist for excision of mole from right breast\\n\\n The patient verbalized understanding of our discussion.Thank you for involving me in her care.\\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me with questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Her abdominal exam is benign. There is no CT evidence of colitis. The patient is at risk for C. difficile infection given recent chemotherapy and antibiotic use. I do not see evidence of neutropenic colitis. Given her severe neutropenia and risk of bacterial translocation, agree to treat with broad-spectrum antibiotic. Anticipate neutropenia to resolve within the next few days. If C. difficile infection confirmed, will complete 10-14 day course of metronidazole.\\n\\nRecommend:  - Continue pip.tazo 4.5 g iv q6h, metronidazole 500 mg iv q8h.\\n- Awaiting stool C. difficile toxin.\\n- Serial abdominal exams, as she recovers from neutropenia.\\n\\nThank you for this consult.

I have discussed the case with the fellow, reviewed the note, history and physical examination as documented by the fellow, formulated the medical decision making, and agree with the documentation included for this visit. I have also assessed a 14 point review of systems which is positive as per the fellow\\'s note and otherwise unremarkable. The patient\\'s past medical history, past surgical history, medications, allergies, review of systems, and psychosocial history was independently reviewed as evidenced by my dated signatures on the electronic medical record created on the day of her office encounter.\\n Ms. Patient41 presents as a new patient referred by Dr. Person2. She has a recently diagnosed stage II, node (-) beast cancer. This was ER+, PR+ and Her2 negative. Ki67 was high at 40% and she had an oncotype sent which returned as 35 in the high range. My recommendation is for chemotherapy, as to what regimen to use, this is up for debate without a specific right or wrong answer. One could consider this as a \"high risk\" node (-) tumor and proceed with an anthracycline and taxane based regimen, as would be used in a node + setting. Alternatively, one could use a more traditional \"node negative\" regimen such as taxotere and cytoxan. We also discussed participation in the NSABP clinical trial of TC x 6 vs. ACT. We discussed that we do not have any data on which of these 2 regimens is best for her type of scenario (node + or high risk node -) taking into account the risks and benefits of chemotherapy; hence the clinical trial is being done. Ms. Patient41 is most concerned about potential long term risks of chemotherapy such as secondary leukemias and heart toxicity. We discussed that these side effects are, in fact, quite rare, but that the TC regimen has not been reported to have these particular side effects\\nShe is agreeable to move forward with TC. We will plan to do at least 4, but potentially up to 6 cycles.\\n I discussed the risks, benefits, and expected side effects which include alopecia, pancytopenia, increased risk of infection with the myelosuppression, anemia, and thrombocytopneia. We discussed gastrointestinal toxicity including nausea and vomiting, esophagitis, and diarrhea, all of which can typically be managed with medications.We discussed neuropathy with the taxane. We also discussed side effects such as mild cognitive\\ndecline \"chemo\" brain, skin and nail changes, flulike symptoms, and generalized fatigue. The benefit oft his treatment is to help reduce the risk of distant disease recurrence. We also reviewed the likely incidence of premature menopause and ovarian failure.\\n We will hold off on neulasta at her request. I think this is appropriate as she is otherwise young and healthy.\\n She will RTC next week to start chemotherapy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I independently reviewed these imaging studies from Women\\'s Imaging North dated May 20, 2013. There were no other studies available for comparison.\\n\\nShe has mildly dense right and left breast tissue. A skin marker was placed at the 10:00 position left breast.\\nThis corresponded to the site of the palpable abnormality.\\n\\nMammogram reveals a spiculated mass at this site. Otherwise, I do not appreciate any sinister masses or indeterminate microcalcifications in the remainder of the left breast or in the right breast.\\n\\nA focused sonogram of the 10:00 position left breast was also reviewed. Sonographic images reveal a 2.6 x 2.3 cm irregular hypoechoic mass. Ultrasound of the left axilla revealed normal appearing lymph nodes.\\n\\nUltrasound guided biopsy of the left breast mass was performed. Pathology has returned as invasive ductal carcinoma, nuclear grade 3. The tumor is ER positive/weakly PR positive. There is no HER-2/neu overexpression.\\n\\nKI-67 proliferative index 40% (high).\\n\\nOnce she received this diagnosis of breast cancer and was referred to our facility, I obtained a bilateral breast MRI to assess for contralateral disease\\n\\nAccording to the MRI report from our facility dated May 28, 2013 MRI revealed no abnormal areas of enhancement in the right breast.\\n\\nMRI did reveal the known carcinoma, 10:00 position left breast .\\nThis tumor is reported to measure 2.4 x 2 x 2.6 cm. It is reported there was slight tenting of the pectoralis muscle without evidence of invasion.\\n\\nThe lymph nodes in the left axilla are reported to appear normal.\\n\\nShe presents for surgical recommendations regarding this left breast cancer.\\n\\nBreast system review: She cannot palpate any other breast lumps or masses.\\nShe denies any nipple discharge, nipple retraction, skin changes or breast pain.\\n\\nPrior breast surgeries: None\\n\\nFamily history of breast cancer: Maternal grandmother diagnosed in her 40s. She also admits to 2 other paternal relatives with breast cancer in their 40s. She had a maternal aunt diagnosed in her 40s with breast cancer.\\n\\nFamily history of other cancers: Maternal aunt and father had colon cancer. Maternal grandfather had esophageal cancer\\n\\nPersonal history cancer: None\\n\\nGynecologic history: Gravida 0. She is having regular menstrual cycles. Age of menarche: 13\\n\\nNo use of birth control pills, fertility drugs or hormone replacement therapy.\\n\\nGynecologic surgeries: None new\\n\\nPast medical history/review of systems: An extensive review of systems and past medical history were performed. This is documented on the new patient intake form.\\n\\nHeight: 5 feet 10 inches. Weight: 218 pounds. Bra size: 38B\\n\\n She admits to allergies to perfumes and occasional sinus congestion. She states she has \"borderline hypertension\"\\n\\nShe has occasional migraines.\\n\\nThe entire remainder of the review of systems and past medical history are negative.\\n\\nSocial history: She is employed as a student advisor at Institution. She lives with her domestic partner. She has smoked intermittently for 10 years one quarter pack of cigarettes per day she. She rarely has an alcoholic beverage\\n\\nDrug allergies: None\\n\\nMedications: Claritin-D daily\\n\\nPhysical exam\\n\\nGen.: This is a pleasant, well-developed and well-nourished female. She is in no distress\\nNeuro: Awake alert oriented x3. Affect is appropriate. She is neurologically intact.\\nHEENT: Atraumatic normocephalic. Pupils equal round reactive to light. Sclerae are anicteric. Conjunctiva pink. EOMs intact.\\nNeck: Supple. Carotids brisk. No palpable neck, supraclavicular or infraclavicular masses\\nCardiac: Regular S1-S2. I do not appreciate any gallops, murmurs or rubs\\nLungs: Bilateral breath sounds are clear to auscultation in all lung fields\\nAbdomen: Soft, nontender and nondistended. No incisions present.\\nBreasts: Breasts were examined in the upright and supine positions. A complete breast exam was performed.\\n\\nHer breasts are symmetrical, nipples everted. She has no skin changes or dimpling in the right or left breast. The right and left nipple-areolar complexes are grossly normal without crusting or excoriation.\\n\\nI cannot palpate any right or left axillary masses.\\n\\nThe right breast is soft. I do not appreciate any palpable masses.\\n\\nThe left breast is also soft. The only palpable mass is at the 10:00 position left breast. This\\nmeasures 2.5 x 2 cm ,is mobile, nontender without overlying skin changes.\\n\\nImpression: 43-year-old female recently diagnosed with an invasive left breast cancer. The tumor is ER positive/PR positive. There is no HER-2/neu overexpression.\\n\\nShe is clinically and sonographically node negative in the left axilla.\\n\\nPlan: At this time, given her familial history of breast cancer, she has met with genetic counselors at Institution women\\'s hospital. BRCA testing was performed and results are pending at the time of this dictation.\\n\\nIf she is discovered to be BRCA negative, she is interested in breast conservation. This is certainly reasonable.\\n\\nShe was explained the procedure and risks associated with a needle localized left breast partial mastectomy including but not limited to bleeding, wound infection, need for reoperation in the event margins are involved with tumor.\\n\\nI then explained the role of nodal staging and have recommended the sentinel node procedure. She was explained the identification of the sentinel nodes using radiotracer and blue dye. She understands if I cannot locate the sentinel nodes, we will proceed with a complete left axillary lymph node dissection.\\nShe was explained this procedure and risks including but\\nnot limited to bleeding, rare need for blood transfusion, wound infection, lifelong risk of arm swelling, as well as expected upper inner arm numbness/tingling from sacrifice of superficial branches of the cutaneous nerves. She appears to understand.\\n\\nIf breast conservation is successful, she is agreeable to whole breast radiotherapy to decrease the likelihood of a local recurrence.\\n\\nI also explained she is a candidate for 5 years of tamoxifen therapy.\\n\\nIn all likelihood, we will plan performance of the Oncotype DX assay on the tumor block to assess her risk of recurrence and benefit of systemic chemotherapy.\\n\\nIn the event she is discovered to harbor the breast cancer gene, she is interested in mastectomies. We will then have her meet with Dr. Person2 to discuss immediate reconstruction.\\n\\nIn anticipation of surgery, I have obtained blood work and a 12-lead EKG.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions and/or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office.\\n\\nAs always, thank you for allowing me to participate in the consultation of your patient.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient41 is a 44 year old female with a history of a T2, N0, M0 left breast invasive ductal carcinoma that was estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive and HER-2 negative.

The specimen was negative for angiolymphatic invasion.\\n\\nIt was reported that the 2mm focus of tumor was at the lateral margin and the largest focus of tumor 1 mm from the anterior and posterior margins of resection.\\n\\nTherefore, I recently reexcised the lateral/anterior/posterior margins of the left breast cavity.\\n\\nExam of the reexcision revealed no evidence of residual carcinoma.\\n\\nThe tumor was\\nER positive with an H score of 160.\\n\\nThere was minimal PR positivity with an H score of 27. There was no HER-2/neu overexpression.\\n\\nThe Oncotype DX assay was performed on the tumor block. This reveals a high risk of recurrence with a score 35. This is likely due to the essentially absent progesterone receptor expression.\\n\\nThe bandages were removed from the left breast and left axilla. The incisions are approximated without\\nany erythema or drainage. She does not have significant seroma formation in the left breast or left axilla.\\n\\nI also excised a ruptured chest wall epidermal inclusion cyst. This incision is also approximated.\\n\\nImpression: 44 year-old female recently treated with breast conservation. Final pathology reveals a stage II (T2 N0 MX) infiltrating ductal carcinoma.\\n\\nAll final margins of resection are free of tumor.\\n\\nThe Oncotype DX assay reveals a high risk of recurrence.\\n\\nPlan: At this time, I explained to Person2 that given the high Oncotype\\nscore she will require adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. We have arranged for her to see Dr. Person12.\\n\\nUpon completion of chemotherapy, she is agreeable to whole breast radiotherapy. We have arranged for her to see Dr. Person6.\\n\\nShe also understands she is a candidate for endocrine therapy.\\n\\nIf she experiences any postoperative difficulties, she will notify our office.\\n\\nOtherwise, she will return in 1 year for a bilateral mammogram and clinical breast exam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

progesterone receptor positive, 130; HER-2/neu negative 0, Ki-67 was 70%.\\n\\nHer family history is negative for breast or gynecologic malignancy.\\nShe had the onset of menarche at age 12.\\nShe had a natural menopause in her early 50s, and no history of hormone replacement therapy.\\nShe has had 3 pregnancies, but no full term deliveries.\\n\\nThe remainder of her past medical and surgical history, medications, allergies, review of systems, and social history are documented in the electronic medical record and reviewed.\\n\\nOn physical examination, this is a healthy-appearing, obese woman, in no acute distress.\\nA comprehensive exam of the breasts is performed with the patient sitting and recumbent.\\nHer breasts are moderate-to-large in size.\\nThey are grossly symmetric.\\nThere is no erythema or edema of the breast skin.\\nThe nipples are normally everted without crusting or excoriation.\\nPalpation of the left breast is negative for mass or concerning fibroglandular thickening.\\nPost-biopsy changes are evident in the left breast 12 o'clock position.\\nThe right breast is without dominant mass or thickening.\\nThere is no right axillary, infra, or supraclavicular adenopathy.\\n\\nI independently reviewed the patient's diagnostic mammogram and post-biopsy films.\\nThe calcifications in the 12 o'clock position of the left breast extend over a 3.5 x 2 cm area.\\nMinimal increased density is associated with the calcifications.\\n\\nMy impression is the patient is a 60-year-old woman who presents with a screening detected, clinical stage I (T1 N0 M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast, ER/PR positive, HER-2/neu negative.\\nIt is my impression is that she has a small component of invasive cancer and the majority of the pathology will be ductal carcinoma in situ.\\nI reassured her that her breast cancer has been detected at a very early stage.\\nMy recommendation would be to proceed with breast conserving surgery.\\nThis would involve a wide excision of the affected area along with a surrounding margin of normal breast tissue.\\nA sentinel node biopsy is recommended due to the finding of invasive carcinoma.\\nAdjuvant whole breast radiation would follow to reduce the risk of local breast cancer recurrence.\\n\\nThe patient is concerned about the risk of lymphedema associated with axillary surgery.\\nShe was reassured that a sentinel node biopsy is associated with lymphedema in 5% or fewer patients.\\nShe is quite anxious about this however.\\nOverall, there is a low probability that she will have axillary node metastasis.\\nAlthough my recommendation would be to perform a sentinel node biopsy, if she is uncomfortable with this\\nprocedure, we could omit it although we potentially risk under staging her disease.\\n\\nPostoperatively, she will be referred to Medical Oncology for recommendations for systemic therapy.\\nI would anticipate that she will benefit from an aromatase inhibitor for a duration of 5 years.\\n\\nThe patient verbalized good understanding regarding her diagnosis.\\nShe has consented to a left segmental mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy.\\nThe patient will contact the office to schedule her surgery as she was undecided regarding a surgery date today.\\n\\nThank you for allowing me to be involved in the care of this patient.\\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me with questions.\\n\\nYours sincerely,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerson6, MD\\nAssociate Professor of Person9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n D: 02/10/2012 02:28 PM (EST)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT: 02/11/2012 07:30 AM (EST)\\nDJN: \\nSJN: \\n959082\\n\\n\\ncc: Person8, MD\\n\\n\\nLocation, PA \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Compared to prior EKG occurred at 20-2013, there has been a decrease in the ventricular rate, without other acute change\\n\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE and MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  This is a 71-year-old female with history of right breast cancer status post mastectomy, GERD, and pulmonary fibrosis with emergency department for increasing edema associated with shortness breath.\\nHer edema is quite mild on objective exam.\\nShe believes this be maybe related to her Arimidex, which is a known side effect of this medication, so this is certainly possible.\\nHowever, differential also includes CHF exacerbation, nephrotic syndrome, liver abnormality.\\nChest x-ray showed bibasilar atelectasis and scarring without any new acute abnormality or pleural effusion. LFTs were within normal limits.\\nA BNP was performed and was not elevated.\\nShe was able to maintain oxygen saturations in the high 90s to 100% on room air during her stay in emergency department with otherwise stable vital signs.\\nShe reports some chest pain on questioning, which has resolved, so was given 325 mg of aspirin. EKG was performed and showed sinus bradycardia without other acute change. Troponins were negative.\\nI have low suspicion that this represents acute coronary syndrome at this time.\\nIt may be related to her underlying pulmonary fibrosis. The attending physician spoke with Dr. Person70, the physician on call for her PCP Dr. Person39 regarding her condition.\\nHe was in agreement with discharge given her lack of laboratory or radiologic abnormality and stable clinical status.\\nShe was discharged home with close followup with Dr. Person39 as an outpatient tomorrow morning.\\nShe will return to the emergency department for any increasing shortness of breath or chest pain tonight.\\nShe voiced understanding of this, and will follow up with Dr. Person39 in the morning for further workup.\\nRESIDENT Person54:  1.\\nEdema\\n2.\\nShortness of breath\\n\\nDISPOSITION: The patient was stable for discharge to home and will follow up with primary care physician.\\nThe plan of care was discussed with the attending physician, and all patient questions were answered at the time of discharge.\\nThe patient was given computer-generated paper discharge instructions with indications for return to the Emergency Department.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional Services\\n Credentials Title and Author\\n\\n Person33: MD.\\n\\n Title: Resident.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerform - Completed by Person51 (on 09/15/2013 20:02)\\n Modify - Completed by Person51 (on 09/15/2013 20:11)\\n Modify - Completed by Person51 (on 09/15/2013 20:15)\\n Modify - Completed by Person51 (on 09/15/2013 23:01)\\n Sign - Completed by Person51 (on 09/15/2013 23:01)\\n VERIFY - Completed by Person51 (on 09/15/2013 23:01)\\n Sign - Requested by Person88 (on )\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

The procedure performed by Dr. Person27.\\nInterim History: Patient39 is a 61 year old postmenopausal woman who presents for her postoperative visit at Institution Womens Surgical Associates following the above procedure. The operation was performed without complication and her recovery has been uneventful until now. She was referred to Dr. Person32 who plans to initiate Arimidex at the completion of radiation. She has been seen by Dr. Person15 who has plans to start XRT in the near future. She called our office last week c/o progressive right breast swelling which has not been associated with any other symptoms until today when she noticed breast erythema as well. She denied breast pain, warmth, incision site discharge, fever or chills. Her incision is well healed and she has no other complaints. Her final pathology demonstrated: infiltrating ductal carcinoma with tubular features, 1.4 cm. Nuclear grade 1, nottingham score 4/9. Lymphovascular invasion absent. Surgical margins negative. 4 lymph nodes were removed, all negative for carcinoma.\\nPhysical Exam: The patients physical examination demonstrates a well healed curvilinear incision of the right breast at 10 o'clock. The axillary wound is well healed. The right breast is larger than the left. There is erythema involving the right breast inferior to the nipple areolar complex which slightly improves when the patient is supine but does not resolve. There is also a minimal amount of erythema at the medial incision corner. There is no associated warmth or tenderness. There is a\\nlarge palpable seroma of the right breast which was visualized with US in the office. After verbal consent, using sterile technique, an 18 gauge needle was used to aspirate 50 cc of benign appearing serous fluid which was sent for C & S. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.\\n\\n Impression: A 61 year old postmenopausal woman with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast treated with segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy now with post-operative seroma s/p aspiration and complaints of right breast edema and erythema, rule out post-operative infection, rule out normal post-operative edema.\\n Recommendations:  1. Begin Keflex 500 mg po four times a day for 10 days. Rx sent to patient's preferred pharmacy.\\n2. Await breast aspirate C & S result.\\n 3. Signs of worsening infection were reviewed with the patient and she was instructed to call immediately if symptoms worsen while on antibiotic.\\n 4. Patient to call in 48 hours to give a condition update. She was given my personal contact information.\\n5. Recommended the use of a supportive bra on a 24 hour basis to alleviate breast edema.\\n Dr. Person27 was present and available in the clinic during the patients visit today.\\n\\nPerson8, PA-C\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Dr. Patient933 from\\npulmonary recommended completing a full course of antibiotics and waiting an\\nadditional seven days before resuming chemotherapy.  This was discussed with\\nthe Some Institution on 09/24/2010.\\n2. Respiratory.  Metastatic breast cancer to the lung with new pneumonia. She\\ndid have a repeat CT scan without dye here.  We did consult Pulmonary.\\nPulmonary recommended changing the Rocephin started on admission to Zosyn.  She\\nis to complete a full 14 day course. She received azithromycin for five days.\\nShe received Duo-Nebs.  We did provide a nebulizer with Duo-Nebs for home use\\nevery four to six hours. She did have cultures that were obtained and were\\nnegative. The patient felt generally weak over the weekend, so we did make the\\ndecision leave her here and continue her intravenous antibiotics.  Today, she\\nis tolerating walking, eating and just general activities without any shortness\\nof breath. She is on room air with no problems whatsoever.  Nebulizer\\nprescription was provided for home, as well as Duo-Nebs.\\n3. FEN/dehydration. We maintained her on intravenous fluids until Friday. Her\\nmagnesium and potassium were noted to be low and we repleted those.  At the\\ntime of discharge, we gave her a  prescription for magnesium oxide 400 mg\\ndaily; she is instructed to take this for approximately one week's time. She is\\nto have her blood work drawn at the Some Institution.\\n\\nDISPOSITION:\\n\\nThe patient is deemed stable for discharge at this time.

At that time she had a biopsy done and\\nhad Stage IIB Adenocarcinoma.  She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and\\nthen had bilateral mastectomy, followed by XRT.  CT CHest performed at that\\ntime showed no evidence of metastatic disease\\nIn April 2010 she started to develop a nonproductive cough and went to her\\noncologist and had a CXR.  She was found to have a LUL collapse and nodule.\\nShe underwent bronchoscopy in August 2010 to further evaluate this nodule,\\nat which time, she was found to have tumor in the airway.  This was biopsied\\nand showed adenocarcinoma of the breast.  Since then she has started on\\nchemotherapy with Taxol.  She has completed 2 cycles to date.\\nHer last chemotherapy was 9/17/2010.  Two days ago she started to have\\nfevers and chills.  She had overall body aches.  She has a productive cough,\\nwith some green sputum, but denies any hemoptysis.  She likely had some\\nrecent sick contacts.  She chronically feels short of breath, but it has\\nbeen more noticeable over the last 2 days.\\n\\nHistories\\nPast Medical History\\n-Breast Cancer diagnosed 2006 after finding lump in her breast\\n-Underwent Neoadjuvant chemo and then bilateral mastectomy followed for XRT\\n-Staged IIB with no mets\\n-April 2010 found to have LUL metastatic disease\\n-Currently on 2nd cycle of Taxol\\n\\nPast Surgical History\\n-Bilateral Mastectomy\\n-Tonsillectomy\\n\\nSocial History\\n-Tobacco: None\\n-EtOH: Rarely\\n-Illicits: None\\n-Single\\n-Works for  PI\\n\\nFamily History\\n-Sister: Breast cancer (Stage I)\\n-Brother: Prostate Cancer\\n-Mother: Colon Cancer\\n\\nHealth Status\\n\\nAllergies\\n\\niodine [Hives]\\n\\n\\nInpatient Medications\\n\\nScheduled Medications\\nalbuterol-ipratropium  (DuoNeb 3 mg-0.5 mg/3 ml inhalation solution)\\n3mL Aerosol QID\\nanastrozole  (Arimidex)   1mg By Mouth Daily\\nceftriaxone  (Rocephin)   1gm IV Q24H\\ndiphenhydrAMINE   50mg By Mouth As DirCPOE\\ndocusate  (Colace)   100mg By Mouth BID\\nfamotidine  (Pepcid)   20mg By Mouth BID\\nheparin   5,000Unit(s) subQ Q12H\\npredniSONE   50mg By Mouth As DirCPOE\\npredniSONE   50mg By Mouth As DirCPOE\\npredniSONE   50mg By Mouth As DirCPOE\\nPRN Medications\\nacetaminophen   650mg By Mouth Q6H\\nAl hydroxide/Mg hydroxide/simethicone  (Mylanta)   30mL By Mouth Q4H\\nalbuterol-ipratropium  (DuoNeb 3 mg-0.5 mg/3 ml inhalation solution)\\n3mL Aerosol Q2H\\ncodeine-guaifenesin  (Robitussin-AC 10 mg-100 mg/5 ml oral syrup)   10mL\\nBy Mouth Q4H\\nibuprofen  (Motrin)   600mg By Mouth Q6H\\nmagnesium hydroxide  (Milk of Magnesia)   30mL By Mouth Daily\\nondansetron  (Zofran)   4mg IV Q8H\\nprochlorperazine  (Compazine)   10mg IV Q6H\\nsenna  (Senokot)   2tab(s) By Mouth AtBedtime\\ntemazepam  (Restoril)   15mg By Mouth AtBedtime\\nOne-Time Medications   (Time shown is time ordered to be given.)\\n[9/21 22:54]     albuterol 0.083%  (albuterol 0.083% inhalation soln)\\n2.5mg Aerosol ONCE\\n[9/21 23:00]     azithromycin  (Zithromax)   500mg IV ONCE\\n[9/22 01:00]     potassium chloride SR  (potassium chloride extended\\nrelease tablet)   40mEq By Mouth ONCE\\nFuture Medications\\n(Starting 10/11 08:00)     risedronate  (Actonel)   150mg By Mouth MonthlyAC\\n\\nContinuous Infusions\\nSodium Chloride 0.9% 1,000 mL    Initial Rate= 100mL/hr IV\\nNS    Initial Rate= 125mL/hr IV\\n\\n\\nReview of Systems\\nConstitutional:  Fever, Chills, Weakness, Fatigue.\\nEye:  Negative.\\nEar/Nose/Mouth/Throat:  Negative.\\nRespiratory:  Shortness of breath, Cough.\\nCardiovascular:  Negative.\\nGastrointestinal:  Nausea.\\nGenitourinary:  Negative.\\nHematology/Lymphatics:  Negative.\\nEndocrine:  Negative.\\nImmunologic:  Negative.\\nMusculoskeletal:  Negative.\\nIntegumentary:  Negative.\\nNeurologic:  Negative.\\nPsychiatric:  Negative.\\nAll other systems are negative\\n\\nSubjective\\nFeels a little better today\\n\\nPhysical Examination\\n\\nVital Signs  (Last 7 in past 36 hours)\\n\\nVitals TempC BP Pulse RR SaO2 FiO2\\n9/22 05:41 36.0 111/60 83 18\\n9/21 23:04  117/68 125 18 97\\n9/21 21:46 38.8 121/71 133 18 93\\n\\n24 Hr Max Temp: 38.8 at  09/21 21:46 Dosing Wt: 51.0 kg (As of 09:21:10\\n21:46)\\n36 Hr Max Temp: 38.8 at  09/21 21:46 BMI: 19.2 (As of 09:21:10 21:46)\\n\\n\\nWeights  (Last 5 in past 7 days)\\n\\nDate / Time Weight(kg) Dosing Wt = 51.0 kg    (As of: 09/21 21:46)\\n9/21 21:46 51.0 9/17 10:09 53.0\\n\\nI & O  (Summary)\\n\\n___________________________________________________\\n\\nI&O    (09/21)   7a-3p    3p-11p    11p-7a     Total\\n(09/22)   7a-3p    3p-11p    11p-7a\\nIntake:      0      0      0      0      0      0      0\\nOutput:      0      0      0      0      0      0      0\\nBalance:      0      0      0      0      0      0      0\\n___________________________________________________\\n\\nGeneral: Laying in bed, NAD, AAO x3, nontoxic, comfortable\\nHEENT: PERRL, EOMI, MMM\\nLungs: Diminished breath sounds at LUL, Bilateral crackles at the bases\\nCV: nl rate, regular rhythm, nl s1, s2, no murmur appreciated\\nAbd: soft, nontender, nondistended, +BS,\\nExt: warm, no LE Edema, 1+ DP pulses\\n\\nReview / Management\\n\\nLabs  (Resulted in the Past 36 hours)\\n\\n\\n9/22 11:19a Appearance, U..

A wire\\nmarker designates a skin scar related to lumpectomy in the lower\\ninner aspect of the left breast.\\nMildly dense fibroglandular parenchyma is present.\\nNo new dominant mass or abnormal clustered microcalcifications\\nsuspicious for malignancy are identified in either breast.  Benign\\nappearing, fat-containing lymph nodes are present in the axillae.\\nSonographic evaluation of the left breast was performed following the\\ndiagnostic mammogram to establish a baseline study.  Ultrasound\\ndemonstrates skin thickening and radiation edema in the left breast.\\nAlso noted is the hypoechoic region beneath the lumpectomy skin scar\\nat 8 o'clock position of the left breast.  On ultrasound, it measures\\n2.3cm in widest dimension.\\nIMPRESSION:\\nPOSTSURGICAL AND POST RADIATION CHANGES IN THE LEFT BREAST,\\nCONSISTENT WITH BREAST CONSERVING SURGERY FOR INFILTRATING DUCTAL\\nCARCINOMA.\\nNO NEW DOMINANT MASS OR ABNORMAL CLUSTERED MICROCALCIFICATIONS\\nSUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANCY DETECTED IN EITHER BREAST.\\nTHE POSTSURGICAL SCAR AT THE LUMPECTOMY SITE AT 8 O'CLOCK POSITION OF\\nTHE LEFT BREAST MEASURES 2.3cm IN WIDEST DIMENSION ON ULTRASOUND.\\nFOLLOWUP MAMMOGRAM IS ADVISED IN 1 YEAR OR SOONER IF WARRANTED\\nCLINICALLY.\\nMS. Person11 WILL BE SENT A WRITTEN SUMMARY OF THE REPORT IN LAY TERMS.\\nBIRAD CATEGORY:  2 - BENIGN FINDINGS (ROUTINE FOLLOWUP).\\nD4\\nEND OF IMPRESSION:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
